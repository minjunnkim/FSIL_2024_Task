The Company\' ability compete successfully depends heavily its ability ensure continuing and timely introduction new innovative products and technologies the marketplace. The Company believes unique that designs and develops virtually the entire solution for its personal computers, consumer electronics, and mobile communication devices, including the hardware, operating system, several software applications, and related services. result, the Company must make significant investments research and development. contrast, many the Company\' competitors seek compete aggressively price and maintain very low cost structures. the Company unable continue develop and sell innovative new products with attractive margins, its financial condition and operating results may materially adversely affected. the market for personal computers and peripherals, the Company faces significant number competitors, many which have broader product lines and larger installed customer bases. There has also been trend toward consolidation that has resulted larger and potentially stronger competitors. Price competition has been particularly intense competitors selling Windows-based personal computers have aggressively cut prices and lowered product margins. The Company also faces increased competition certain its key market segments, including consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. increasing number Internet devices that include software applications and are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers compete for market share with the Company\' existing products.

The Company expects competition intensify competitors attempt imitate the Company\' approach providing these components seamlessly within their individual offerings work collaboratively offer integrated solutions. Some current and potential competitors have substantial resources and experience, and they may able provide such products and services little profit even loss. There can assurance the Company will able continue provide products and services that effectively compete. remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions. Due the highly volatile and competitive nature the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products. The success new product introductions depends number factors, including timely and successful completion development efforts, market acceptance, the Company\' ability manage the risks associated with new products and production ramp issues, the availability application software for new products, the effective management purchase commitments and inventory levels line with anticipated product demand, the availability products appropriate quantities and costs meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality other defects the early stages introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine advance the ultimate effect new product introductions and transitions will have financial condition and operating results. The Company faces substantial inventory and other asset risk. The Company records write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete are excess anticipated demand net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees for orders products and components that have been cancelled. The Company also reviews its long-lived assets for impairment whenever events changed circumstances indicate the carrying amount asset may not recoverable. the Company determines that impairment exists, records write-down equal the amount which the carrying value the assets exceeds its fair market value.

The Company\' financial condition and operating results have been the past and may the future materially adversely affected the Company\' ability manage its inventory levels and respond short-term shifts customer demand patterns. Future operating results depend upon the Company\' ability obtain key components, including microprocessors and NAND flash memory, favorable prices and sufficient quantities. Because the Company currently obtains certain key components, including microprocessors, enclosures, certain LCDs, certain optical drives, and application-specific integrated circuits ("ASICs"), from single limited sources, the Company subject significant supply and pricing risks. Many these and other key components that are available from multiple sources, including NAND flash memory, DRAM memory, and certain LCDs, are subject times industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. The Company has entered into certain agreements for the supply critical components favorable pricing, but there guarantee that the Company will able extend renew these agreements favorable terms upon expiration otherwise obtain favorable pricing the future. Therefore, the Company remains subject significant risks supply shortages and price increases that can have material adverse effect its financial condition and operating results. The Company expects experience decreases its gross margin percentage fiscal year , compared levels achieved during fiscal year , due part current and expected future price increases for certain components. See "Management\' Discussion and Analysis Financial Condition and Results Operations\x97Gross Margin." The Company\' new products often use custom components from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. Where component product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers\' yields have matured. The Company and other producers the personal computer, consumer electronics and mobile communication industries also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products. The Company uses some custom components that are not common the rest the personal computer, consumer electronics mobile communication industries. Continued availability these components acceptable prices may affected producers decide concentrate the production components other than those customized meet the Company\' requirements. the supply key component for new existing product were delayed constrained, such components were available only significantly higher prices, the Company\' financial condition and operating results could materially adversely affected. The Company depends component and product manufacturing and logistics services provided third parties, many whom are located outside the . Most the Company\' components and products are manufactured whole part third-party manufacturers, most which are located outside the . significant concentration this outsourced manufacturing currently performed only few third-party manufacturers, often single locations. The Company has also outsourced much its transportation and logistics management.

There were three significant differences the measurement the Retail segment\' results relative the Company\' other operating segments. First, the Retail segment\' operating income reflected cost sales for Apple products amounts normally charged Apple\' major . channel partners for the same products, less the cost the Company\' sales programs and other costs support those partners. Second, the cost sales the Company\' service and support contracts, including the AppleCare Protection Plan ("APP") and Mac, were reflected the Retail segment\' results the costs charged major channel partners for such contracts, and all associated revenue was reflected the Retail segment\' results the time sale rather than being amortized over the lives the respective agreements.

Third, the Company allocated certain expenses related the operation its high-profile stores corporate marketing expense. Having operated the Company\' Retail stores successfully for more than six years, management believes its Retail initiative proven concept that will continue integral element the Company\' distribution and marketing strategies. Additionally, the Company expects sales iPhone the Company\' geographic and Retail operating segments generate significant levels deferred revenue and deferred cost sales over time. consideration these factors, management has determined that beginning with the quarter ended June , , aligning measurements for the performance the Retail segment with those used for the Company\' other operating segments provides the most meaningful information.

Additionally, the Retail segment applying the same subscription accounting iPhone net sales and cost sales that the Company\' other operating segments apply.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY This section explains Apple\' executive compensation program relates the following "named executive officers:" User-specified TAGGED TABLE Steve Jobs Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook Chief Operating Officer Peter Oppenheimer Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer Ron Johnson Senior Vice President, Retail Sales Tony Fadell Senior Vice President, iPod Division end user-specified TAGGED TABLE Apple\' executive compensation program for the named executive officers consists long-term equity awards the form restricted stock units ("RSUs") and cash compensation the form performance-based cash incentives and base salaries. Each year, the Compensation Committee, which made entirely independent directors, determines the compensation for the named executive officers. Apple relies heavily long-term equity awards attract and retain outstanding executive team and ensure strong connection between executive compensation and financial performance. RSU award gives the named executive officer the right receive, cost, specified number shares Apple common stock when the award vests, typically intervals two four years. Because the value the RSUs depends Apple\' future share price, the award links compensation future financial performance. The officer generally not eligible receive the shares employment terminated before the RSUs vest. The Compensation Committee reviews annually the outstanding, unvested equity awards each named executive officer determine, the Committee\' discretion, whether additional awards are warranted light the officer\' performance, the competitive environment and the other factors discussed Section below. The performance-based cash incentives compensate the named executive officers for achieving specific financial goals established annually the Compensation Committee, described Section . The Committee sets aggressive performance goals each year based the revenue and operating income objectives Apple\' internal business plan. Payments are not automatic, however, because the Committee may exercise its discretion reduce (but not increase) the amount any incentive payment based officer\' overall performance. Based the factors discussed Section below and the Committee\' belief that the outstanding, unvested equity awards still had significant retention value, the Committee made new equity awards the named executive officers fiscal . The officers earned cash incentives fiscal the maximum amount allowed the plan\x97 % base salary\x97because Apple\' financial performance significantly exceeded the annual performance goals set the Committee. The Committee assessed both the amount and allocation the compensation components for each officer based Apple\' overall annual financial performance and each officer\' individual performance. The Committee did not increase base salaries for the named executive officers because concluded that the total compensation for each officer was appropriate.

The Committee believes the compensation the named executive officers has been appropriate and fair light Apple\' performance. . EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION OBJECTIVES Apple\' goal for executive compensation simple: attract and retain exceptionally talented, entrepreneurial and creative team executives who will provide the leadership for Apple\' success dynamic, highly-competitive markets. . EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION OVERVIEW . Three Components The compensation program for the named executive officers consists the following three components, order their importance: \x95 Long-term equity awards the form RSUs under the shareholder-approved Employee Stock Plan \x95 Annual performance-based cash incentives under the shareholder-approved Performance Bonus Plan (the CEO, however, does not participate this plan and not eligible for performance-based cash incentives) \x95 Base salary The named executive officers are also eligible participate Apple\' health and welfare programs, Employee Stock Purchase Plan, ( ) Plan, patent bonus program and other minor employee recognition programs the same basis other employees. . Mix Equity, Cash Incentives and Salary Apple relies heavily long-term equity awards because the Compensation Committee believes they are the most effective compensation element for attracting entrepreneurial, creative executives and promoting their long-term commitment Apple. RSU award generally vests only the named executive officer continues employment until the specified vesting date, typically two four years after the date grant. Equity awards also help ensure strong connection between executive compensation and Apple\' financial performance because the value RSUs depends Apple\' future share price. Although the Compensation Committee reviews the compensation practices its peer companies described Section below, the Committee does not adhere strict formulas survey data determine the mix compensation elements. Instead, described Section , the Committee considers various factors exercising its discretion determine compensation, including the experience, responsibilities and performance each named executive officer well Apple\' overall financial performance. This flexibility particularly important designing compensation arrangements attract new executives highly-competitive, rapidly changing markets. . Elements Compensation Not Included The Compensation Program The current compensation program for the named executive officers, including the CEO, does not include the following: \x95 Employment contracts ZEQ.= ,SEQ= ,EFW=" ", ="APPLE INC.", =" ",CHK= ,FOLIO=\' \',FILE=\'DISK127:[07ZDP1 07ZDP19701]GC19701A.; \',USER=\'JJORGE\', =\' -NOV- ; : \' \x95 Cash bonuses other than the performance-based cash incentives under the Performance Bonus Plan and payments under the patent bonus program \x95 Severance and change control arrangements beyond what available all . employees (with the exception rights accelerated vesting previously granted part equity awards that will fully vest March ) \x95 Perquisites personal benefits that are not available employees generally \x95 Guarantees the value equity awards .

When the director grant (which increased , shares after two stock splits) was due expire August , . Jobs exercised the option and currently holds these , shares. . EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION . Team-Based Compensation The compensation program for the named executive officers rests two assumptions. First, each officer must demonstrate exceptional personal performance order remain part the executive team. Second, each officer must contribute member the team Apple\' overall success rather than merely achieve specific objectives within that officer\' area responsibility. . Independent Compensation Committee Determines All Executive Compensation The Compensation Committee determines all compensation for the named executive officers. All three Committee members are independent Apple\' management.

The CEO does not participate the Committee\' deliberations decision with regard his compensation. the Committee\' request, the CEO reviews with the Committee the performance the other four named executive officers, but other named executive officer has any input into executive compensation decisions. The Committee gives considerable weight the CEO\' evaluation the other named executive officers because his direct knowledge each officer\' performance and contributions. For each officer, the Committee members independently determine each component compensation based their collective assessment the officer\' performance well Apple\' overall financial performance. . The Crucial Role Long-Term Equity Awards Overview. The Committee believes that long-term equity awards are the most effective way attract and retain superlative executive team. Accordingly, executive compensation heavily weighted toward long-term equity awards rather than cash compensation, and the awards have long vesting intervals maximize their retention value. This approach reflected the following: \x95 The CEO\' compensation has been generally tied long-term equity; for example, his last equity award did not vest for three years. \x95 For the other four named executive officers, equity awards represented approximately % their target total compensation fiscal . This compares approximately % Apple\' peer companies. \x95 Fiscal equity awards vested % the second anniversary the grant date; the remaining % will vest the fourth anniversary the grant date. \x95 Fiscal equity awards not vest all until , when they vest full. designing long-term equity awards, the Committee seeks maximize their effectiveness accomplishing Apple\' compensation objectives while recognizing the Board\' duty Apple\' shareholders limit equity dilution. The Committee believes this balance has been achieved follows: Restricted Stock Units Minimize Dilution and Support Long-Term Focus. Since fiscal , all equity awards the named executive officers have been RSUs rather than stock options. grant RSUs gives officer the right receive specified number shares Apple common stock, cost the officer, the officer remains employed Apple until the RSUs vest. RSUs granted also provide for accelerated vesting the named executive officer terminated without cause change control, RSUs granted before provide for accelerated vesting change control, and all RSUs provide for accelerated vesting upon the death the officer. The compensation value RSU does not depend solely future stock price increases; grant, its value equal Apple\' stock price. Although its value may increase decrease with changes the stock price during the period before vesting, RSU will have value the long term, encouraging retention. contrast, the entire compensation value stock option depends future stock price appreciation. Accordingly, RSUs can deliver significantly greater share-for-share compensation value grant than stock options, and Apple can offer comparable grant date compensation value with fewer shares and less dilution for its shareholders. Long Vesting Intervals Maximize Retention. All vesting RSUs generally subject continued employment. Except for occasional new hire grants, vesting occurs intervals ZEQ.= ,SEQ= ,EFW=" ", ="APPLE INC.", =" ",CHK= ,FOLIO=\' \',FILE=\'DISK127:[07ZDP1 07ZDP19701]GC19701A.; \',USER=\'JJORGE\', =\' -NOV- ; : \' less than two years after the grant date. This ensures that meaningful portion named executive officer\' awards will vest every two years\x97 strong incentive continue employment with Apple. The following table shows the grant and vesting patterns for ongoing RSU grants for the named executive officers since fiscal (excluding those who were not named executive officers the time grant).

From time time, the Compensation Committee has considered various forms performance-based vesting. After careful evaluation, the Committee has concluded that performance-based vesting would not serve Apple\' current objectives effectively the program described above. The Committee generally grants RSUs with two four year vesting periods maximize the award\' retention value. This retention value would undermined named executive officer\' equity awards (which represent approximately % the officer\' compensation) were risk based performance measures that were determined two even four years prior the vesting date. Given the intensely dynamic business environment which Apple operates, would extremely difficult craft meaningful objectives with such long horizon. Apple imposes requirement that the named executive officers hold their common stock for any period after vesting. Annual Burn Rate Averages Less Than %. fiscal , Apple committed annual "burn rate" (the total number all equity award shares granted during the fiscal year divided the total shares outstanding the end the fiscal year) % from fiscal through fiscal . This commitment represented significant reduction from average burn rate % from fiscal through fiscal . fact, Apple\' average annual burn rate from fiscal through fiscal was approximately %. Overhang from Equity Plans %. Overhang (granted and outstanding equity awards plus shares reserved for future awards, divided the sum total shares outstanding, granted and outstanding equity awards, and shares reserved for future awards) another measure equity dilution. The efficient use equity awards, combined with the substantial exercise employee stock options due the significant increase Apple\' stock price over the past few years, has caused Apple\' overhang decline from approximately % the end fiscal approximately % the end fiscal . Frequency and Size Equity Awards. The named executive officers typically receive equity awards every two years, rather than every year. This practice consistent with the long time horizon and lengthy vesting periods the awards. making awards less frequently, the Committee can provide larger grants, which turn promotes greater retention. determine the size RSU grants, the Compensation Committee first establishes target compensation value that wants deliver the named executive officers through long-term equity awards. doing , the Committee considers various factors, including the following: \x95 The practice granting equity only every two years \x95 The heavy weight placed equity the mix total compensation ZEQ.= ,SEQ= ,EFW=" ", ="APPLE INC.", =" ",CHK= ,FOLIO=\' \',FILE=\'DISK127:[07ZDP1 07ZDP19701]GC19701A.; \',USER=\'JJORGE\', =\' -NOV- ; : \' \x95 The officer\' experience and performance \x95 The scope, responsibility and business impact the officer\' position \x95 The perceived retention value the total compensation package light the competitive environment Once the target value has been established, the Committee determines the number shares reference the current value Apple\' common stock. . The Minor Role Cash Compensation Base Salaries. The Committee believes that base salaries are significantly less important than performance-based bonuses and long-term equity awards meeting Apple\' compensation objectives. The minor role salaries part total compensation reflected the following: \x95 The CEO has received annual base salary $ since rejoining Apple . \x95 The fiscal average base salary for the other named executive officers was below median among the peer companies shown Section , despite Apple\' significantly greater financial and business success. \x95 Base salaries for the named executive officers have not increased since October , except for promotion-related increase for one officer. Performance-Based Cash Incentives. The Performance Bonus Plan, which has been approved Apple\' shareholders, authorizes the Committee issue plan-based cash incentive awards compensate officers for achieving specific financial objectives that are established annually. The Committee believes that performance-based cash compensation important component executive compensation; however, represents small percentage total compensation because its effectiveness meeting Apple\' compensation objectives limited. less significant factor attracting new executive talent than equity compensation, and promotes retention only the short-term\x97over the performance period. Accordingly, the plan modestly funded, reflected the following: \x95 The CEO does not participate the Performance Bonus Plan. \x95 Apple\' target payout % base salary significantly lower than peer companies group, where median target bonus payouts range from % % base salary. \x95 The maximum payout % for exceptional performance also lower than peer companies, where times the target range ( ., % % base salary) becoming increasingly common. The Compensation Committee establishes performance goals each year based revenue and operating income objectives Apple\' internal business plan. The Committee has selected these performance goals because they are important indicators increased shareholder value. These performance goals generally exclude the effects extraordinary, unusual infrequently occurring events changes accounting principles. Apple does not publicly disclose specific annual internal revenue operating income objectives, its business plan highly confidential. Disclosing specific objectives would provide competitors and other third parties with insights into the planning process and would therefore cause competitive harm. The Committee next determines the maximum amount any cash incentive payment denominated percentage base salary. The current payment structure shown the payout matrix below. Once the performance goals and payment structure are established, one has the authority modify waive them.

Thus, there considerable risk that payments will not made all will made less than %. For the past three years, the performance goals have reflected double-digit growth both revenue and operating income. four the past eight years, Apple did not meet one both performance goals. This uncertainty ensures that any payments under the plan are truly performance-based, consistent with the plan\' objectives. the end the year, the Committee determines the amount the award paid each officer comparing actual results the performance goals. The Committee may, its discretion, reduce (but not increase) the amount any individual award based the officer\' overall performance. The plan does not provide for the adjustment recovery award paid named executive officer the results previous year are subsequently restated adjusted manner that would have originally resulted smaller award. .

The Role Peer Groups, Surveys and Benchmarking With the assistance .

Furthermore, the Committee believes that excessive reliance benchmarking detrimental shareholder interests because can result compensation that unrelated the value delivered the named executive officers. . Tax and Accounting Considerations Tax Deductibility Compensation Expense. Section ( ) the Internal Revenue Code places limit $ , , the amount compensation certain officers that may deducted Apple business expense any tax year unless, among other things, the compensation performance-based and has been approved the shareholders. qualify performance-based compensation, the amount compensation must depend the officer\' performance against pre-determined performance goals established committee that consists solely least two "outside" directors who have never been employed Apple its subsidiaries.

Campbell independent director under SEC and NASDAQ governance standards, does not qualify outside director because was officer Apple from and Apple subsidiary from . For this reason, does not discuss vote any Section ( )-related matters. Salaries for the named executive officers not qualify performance-based compensation. Apple\' performance-based cash incentives, however, are exempt from the Section ( ) limit because they are paid based predetermined goals established the Compensation Committee pursuant the shareholder-approved Performance Bonus Plan. The RSUs not qualify performance-based compensation for purposes Section ( ) because vesting based continued employment rather than specific performance goals. See page for explanation Apple\' decision not implement performance-based vesting. Tax Implications for Officers. Section 409A the Internal Revenue Code imposes additional income taxes executive officers for certain types deferred compensation that not comply with Section 409A. Because Apple does not generally provide deferred compensation the named executive officers, this limitation has impact the structure the compensation program for the officers. Section 280G the Internal Revenue Code imposes excise tax payments executives severance change control compensation that exceed the levels specified Section 280G. The named executive officers could receive the amounts shown the table page severance change control payments, but the Committee does not consider their potential impact compensation program design. Accounting Considerations. The Committee also considers the accounting and cash flow implications various forms executive compensation. its financial statements, Apple records salaries and performance-based compensation incentives expenses the amount paid, paid, the named executive officers. Accounting rules also require Apple record expense its financial statements for equity awards, even though equity awards are not paid cash employees. The accounting expense equity awards employees calculated accordance with SFAS 123R. The Committee believes, however, that the many advantages equity compensation, discussed above, more than compensate for the non-cash accounting expense associated with them.
