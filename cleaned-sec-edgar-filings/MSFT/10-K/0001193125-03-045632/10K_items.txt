Under the Open Source model, software produced loosely associated groups unpaid programmers, and the resulting software and the intellectual property contained therein licensed end users substantially cost. The most notable example Open Source software the Linux operating system. While believe that our products provide customers with significant advantages security and productivity, and generally have lower total cost ownership than Open Source software, the popularization the Open Source model continues pose significant challenge our business model, including recent efforts proponents the Open Source model convince governments worldwide mandate the use Open Source software their purchase and deployment software products. the extent the Open Source model gains increasing market acceptance, sales our products may decline, may have reduce the prices charge for our products, and revenues and operating margins may consequently decline.

From time time receive notices from others claiming infringe their intellectual property rights. The number these claims may grow. Responding these claims may require enter into royalty and licensing agreements unfavorable terms, require stop selling redesign affected products, pay damages satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. have made and expect continue making significant expenditures acquire the use technology and intellectual property rights, including via cross-licenses broad patent portfolios.

Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples include estimates loss contingencies and product life cycles, and assumptions such the elements comprising software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrade enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility achieved for our products; the potential outcome future tax consequences events that have been recognized our financial statements tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management\x92 estimates and assumptions. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded foreign currencies are translated the exchange rate the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated average rates exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged credited other comprehensive income (OCI).

The amount revenue allocated undelivered elements based the sales price those elements when sold separately (vendor-specific objective evidence) using the residual method. Under the residual method, the total fair value the undelivered elements, indicated vendor-specific objective evidence, recorded unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount recorded unearned for the undelivered elements recognized revenue related delivered elements. Unearned revenue due undelivered elements recognized ratably straight-line basis over the related product\x92 life cycle, which currently estimated three and half years for Windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications (primarily Office). Revenue from multi-year licensing arrangements are accounted for subscriptions, with billings recorded unearned revenue and recognized revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. Certain multi-year licensing arrangements include rights receive future versions software product when-and- -available basis under Open and Select volume licensing programs (currently named Software Assurance and, previously, Upgrade Advantage). addition, other multi-year licensing arrangements include perpetual license for current products combined with rights receive future versions software products when-and- -available basis under Open, Select, and Enterprise Agreement volume licensing programs. MSN Internet Access subscriptions, Microsoft bCentral subscriptions, and Microsoft Developer Network subscriptions are also accounted for subscriptions. Revenue related our Xbox game console recognized upon shipment the product retailers. Online advertising revenue recognized advertisements are displayed. Consulting services revenue recognized services are rendered, generally based the negotiated hourly rate the consulting arrangement and the number hours worked during the period. Costs related insignificant obligations, which include telephone support for developer tools software, games, computer hardware, and Xbox, are accrued when the related revenue recognized. Provisions are recorded for estimated returns, concessions, and bad debts. Cost Revenue Cost revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold, operation costs related product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery consulting services. Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Technological feasibility for our software products reached shortly before the products are released manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility established are not material, and accordingly, expense all research and development costs when incurred.

Once decline fair value determined other-than-temporary, impairment charge recorded and new cost basis the investment established. use derivative instruments manage exposures foreign currency, security price, interest rate, and credit risks. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the impact these exposures effectively possible. Foreign Currency Risk. Certain forecasted transactions and assets are exposed foreign currency risk. monitor our foreign currency exposures daily maximize the overall effectiveness our foreign currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Non . dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated fair value hedging instruments under SFAS . Options used hedge portion forecasted international revenue for three years the future are designated cash flow hedging instruments.

Securities Price Risk. Strategic equity investments are subject market price risk. From time time, use and designate options hedge fair values and cash flows certain equity securities. determine the security, forecasted sale thereof, selected for hedging market conditions, -front costs, and other relevant factors. Once established, the hedges are not dynamically managed traded, and are generally not removed until maturity. Interest Rate Risk. Fixed-income securities are subject interest rate risk. The fixed-income portfolio diversified and consists primarily investment grade securities minimize credit risk. use exchange-traded option and future contracts, not designated hedging instruments under SFAS , hedge interest rate risk. addition, routinely use options, not designated hedging instruments under SFAS , hedge our exposure interest rate risk the event catastrophic increase interest rates. Other Derivatives. Swap contracts, not designated hedging instruments under SFAS , are used manage exposures credit risks. addition, may invest warrants purchase securities other companies strategic investment. Warrants that can net share settled are deemed derivative financial instruments and are not designated hedging instruments. Announced forward purchase commitments mortgage-backed assets are also considered derivatives cases where physical delivery the assets are not taken the earliest available delivery date. For options designated either fair value cash flow hedges, changes the time value are excluded from the assessment hedge effectiveness. / MSFT FORM - Part , Item Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate probable losses inherent the account receivable balance. determine the allowance based known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence.

APPLICATION CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared accordance with . GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected management\x92 application accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for include revenue recognition, impairment investment securities, impairment goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, and accounting for income taxes. account for the licensing software accordance with American Institute Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement Position (SOP) - , Software Revenue Recognition. The application SOP - requires judgment, including whether software arrangement includes multiple elements, and , whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) fair value exists for those elements. End users receive certain elements our products over period time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right receive unspecified upgrades enhancements Microsoft Internet Explorer when-and- -available basis, the fair value which recognized over the product\x92 estimated life cycle. Changes the elements software arrangement, the ability identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value the respective elements, and changes product\x92 estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount earned and unearned revenue. Judgment also required assess whether future releases certain software represent new products upgrades and enhancements existing products. SFAS , Accounting for Certain Investments Debt and Equity Securities , and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) , Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities , provide guidance determining when investment other-than-temporarily impaired. This determination requires significant judgment. making this judgment, evaluate, among other factors, the duration and extent which the fair value investment less than its cost; the financial health and near-term business outlook for the investee, including factors such industry and sector performance, changes technology, and operational and financing cash flow; and our intent and ability hold the investment. SFAS , Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , requires that goodwill tested for impairment the reporting unit level (operating segment one level below operating segment) annual basis (July for Microsoft) and between annual tests certain circumstances. Application the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification reporting units, assigning assets and liabilities reporting units, assigning goodwill reporting units, and determining the fair value each reporting unit. Significant judgments required estimate the fair value reporting units include estimating future cash flows, determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions. Changes these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. account for research and development costs accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS , Accounting for Research and Development Costs , and SFAS , Accounting for the Costs Computer Software Sold, Leased, Otherwise Marketed. SFAS specifies that costs incurred internally creating computer software product should charged expense when incurred research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility established, all software costs should capitalized until the product available for general release customers. Judgment required determining when technological feasibility product established. have determined that technological feasibility for our products reached shortly before the products are released manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility established are not material, and accordingly, expense all research and development costs when incurred. are subject various legal proceedings and claims, the outcomes which are subject significant uncertainty. SFAS , Accounting for Contingencies , requires that estimated loss from loss contingency should accrued charge income probable that asset has been impaired liability has been incurred and the amount the loss can reasonably estimated. Disclosure contingency required there least reasonable possibility that loss has been incurred. evaluate, among other factors, the degree probability unfavorable outcome and the ability make reasonable estimate the amount loss. Changes these factors could materially impact our financial position our results operations. SFAS , Accounting for Income Taxes , establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect income taxes. The objectives accounting for income taxes are recognize the amount taxes payable refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences events that have been recognized entity\x92 financial statements tax returns. Judgment required assessing the future tax consequences events that have been recognized our financial statements tax returns. Fluctuations the actual outcome these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position our results operations. ISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES This Annual Report Form - contains statements that are forward-looking. These statements are based current expectations and assumptions that are subject risks and uncertainties. Actual results could differ materially because issues and uncertainties such those listed below and elsewhere this report, which, among others, should considered evaluating our financial outlook. Challenges our Business Model Since our inception, our business model has been based upon customers agreeing pay fee license software developed and distributed . Under this commercial software model, software developers bear the costs converting original ideas into software products through investments research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenues received from the distribution their products. believe the commercial software model has had substantial benefits for users software, allowing them rely our expertise and the expertise other software developers that have powerful incentives develop / MSFT FORM - Part , Item innovative software that useful, reliable, and compatible with other software and hardware. recent years, there has been growing challenge the commercial software model, often referred the Open Source model. Under the Open Source model, software produced loosely associated groups unpaid programmers, and the resulting software and the intellectual property contained therein licensed end users substantially cost. The most notable example Open Source software the Linux operating system. While believe that our products provide customers with significant advantages security and productivity, and generally have lower total cost ownership than Open Source software, the popularization the Open Source model continues pose significant challenge our business model, including recent efforts proponents the Open Source model convince governments worldwide mandate the use Open Source software their purchase and deployment software products. the extent the Open Source model gains increasing market acceptance, sales our products may decline, may have reduce the prices charge for our products, and revenues and operating margins may consequently decline. Intellectual Property Rights defend our intellectual property rights, but unlicensed copying and use software and intellectual property rights represents loss revenue . While this adversely affects . revenue, the impact revenue from outside the United States more significant, particularly countries where laws are less protective intellectual property rights. Throughout the world, actively educate consumers about the benefits licensing genuine products and educate lawmakers about the advantages business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. However, continued educational and enforcement efforts may not affect revenue positively and further deterioration compliance with existing legal protections reductions the legal protection for intellectual property rights software developers could adversely affect revenue. From time time receive notices from others claiming infringe their intellectual property rights. The number these claims may grow. Responding these claims may require enter into royalty and licensing agreements unfavorable terms, require stop selling redesign affected products, pay damages satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. have made and expect continue making significant expenditures acquire the use technology and intellectual property rights, including via cross-licenses broad patent portfolios. New Products and Services have made significant investments research, development and marketing for new products, services and technologies, including Microsoft NET, Xbox, business applications, MSN, mobile and wireless technologies, and television. Significant revenue from new product and service investments may not achieved for number years, all. Moreover, these products and services may never profitable, and even they are profitable, operating margins for these businesses are not expected high the margins historically experienced . Litigation discussed Note \x96 Contingencies the Notes Financial Statements, are subject variety claims and lawsuits. While believe that none the litigation matters which are currently involved will have material adverse impact our financial position results operations, possible that one more these matters could resolved manner that ultimately would have material adverse impact our business, and could negatively impact our revenues, operating margins, and net income. Declines Demand for Software overall market demand for PCs, servers and other computing devices declines significantly, consumer corporate spending for such products declines, our revenue will adversely affected. Additionally, our revenues would unfavorably impacted customers reduce their purchases new software products upgrades existing products because new product offerings are not perceived adding significant new functionality other value prospective purchasers. significant number customers purchased license agreements providing upgrade rights specific licensed products prior the transition Licensing July . These agreements will expire and and the rate which such customers renew these contracts could adversely affect future revenues. are also committing significant investments the next release the Windows operating system, codenamed Longhorn. this system not perceived offering significant new functionality value prospective purchasers, our revenues and operating margins could adversely affected. Product Development Schedule The development software products complex and time-consuming process. New products and enhancements existing products can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays new product releases significant problems creating new products, particularly any delays the Longhorn operating system, could adversely affect our revenues. General Economic and Geo-Political Risks Continued softness corporate information technology spending other changes general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware software could adversely affect our revenues. Terrorist activity and armed conflict pose the additional risk general economic disruption and could require changes our international operations and security arrangements, thus increasing our operating costs. These conditions lend additional uncertainty the timing and budget for technology investment decisions our customers. Competition continue experience intensive competition across all markets for our products and services. These competitive pressures may result decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and increased operating costs, such for marketing and sales incentives, resulting lower revenues, gross margins and operating income. Taxation Extraterritorial Income August , World Trade Organization (\x93WTO\x94) dispute panel determined that the tax provisions the FSC Repeal and Extraterritorial Income Exclusion Act (\x93ETI\x94) constitute export subsidy prohibited the WTO Agreement Subsidies / MSFT FORM - Part , Item , and Countervailing Measures. The . government appealed the panel\x92 decision and lost its appeal. the ETI provisions are repealed and financially comparable replacement tax legislation not enacted, the loss the ETI tax benefit could significant. Other Potential Tax Liabilities are subject income taxes both the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment required determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. the ordinary course our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination uncertain. are regularly under audit tax authorities. Although believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination tax audits and any related litigation could materially different than that which reflected historical income tax provisions and accruals. Should additional taxes assessed result audit litigation, material effect our income tax provision and net income the period periods for which that determination made could result. Finite Insurance Programs addition conventional third party insurance arrangements, have entered into captive insurance arrangements for the purpose protecting against possible catastrophic and other risks not covered traditional insurance markets. June , , potential coverage available under captive insurance arrangements was $ billion, subject deductibles, exclusions, and other restrictions. While believe these arrangements are effective way insure against such risks, the potential liabilities associated with certain the issues and uncertainties discussed herein could exceed the coverage provided such arrangements. Other Other issues and uncertainties may include: Â· warranty and other claims for hardware products such Xbox; Â· the effects the Consent Decree . . Microsoft and Final Judgment State New York . Microsoft the Windows operating system and server business, including those associated with protocol and other disclosures required the Decree and Final Judgment and the ability manufacturers hide end user access certain new Windows features; Â· the continued availability third party distribution channels for MSN service and other online services; Â· factors associated with our international operations, described under International Operations Part , Item this report; and Â· financial market volatility other changes affecting the value our investments, such the Comcast Corporation securities held , that may result reduction carrying value and recognition losses including impairment charges.

Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples include estimates loss contingencies and product life cycles, and assumptions such the elements comprising software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrade enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility achieved for our products; the potential outcome future tax consequences events that have been recognized our financial statements tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management\x92 estimates and assumptions. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded foreign currencies are translated the exchange rate the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated average rates exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged credited other comprehensive income (OCI). Revenue Recognition Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and perpetual licenses for current products under our Open and Select volume licensing programs generally recognized products are shipped, with portion the revenue recorded unearned due undelivered elements including, some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right receive unspecified upgrades enhancements Microsoft Internet Explorer when-and- -available basis. The amount revenue allocated undelivered elements based the sales price those elements when sold separately (vendor-specific objective evidence) using the residual method. Under the residual method, the total fair value the undelivered elements, indicated vendor-specific objective evidence, recorded unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount recorded unearned for the undelivered elements recognized revenue related delivered elements. Unearned revenue due undelivered elements recognized ratably straight-line basis over the related product\x92 life cycle, which currently estimated three and half years for Windows operating systems and two years for desktop applications (primarily Office). Revenue from multi-year licensing arrangements are accounted for subscriptions, with billings recorded unearned revenue and recognized revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. Certain multi-year licensing arrangements include rights receive future versions software product when-and- -available basis under Open and Select volume licensing programs (currently named Software Assurance and, previously, Upgrade Advantage). addition, other multi-year licensing arrangements include perpetual license for current products combined with rights receive future versions software products when-and- -available basis under Open, Select, and Enterprise Agreement volume licensing programs. MSN Internet Access subscriptions, Microsoft bCentral subscriptions, and Microsoft Developer Network subscriptions are also accounted for subscriptions. Revenue related our Xbox game console recognized upon shipment the product retailers. Online advertising revenue recognized advertisements are displayed. Consulting services revenue recognized services are rendered, generally based the negotiated hourly rate the consulting arrangement and the number hours worked during the period. Costs related insignificant obligations, which include telephone support for developer tools software, games, computer hardware, and Xbox, are accrued when the related revenue recognized. Provisions are recorded for estimated returns, concessions, and bad debts. Cost Revenue Cost revenue includes manufacturing and distribution costs for products and programs sold, operation costs related product support service centers and product distribution centers, costs incurred support and maintain Internet-based products and services, and costs associated with the delivery consulting services. Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related costs associated with product development. Technological feasibility for our software products reached shortly before the products are released manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility established are not material, and accordingly, expense all research and development costs when incurred. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, and other headcount-related costs well expenses related advertising, promotions, tradeshows, seminars, and other programs.

Equity and other investments include debt and equity instruments. Debt securities and publicly traded equity securities are classified available for sale and are recorded market using the specific identification method. Unrealized gains and losses (excluding other-than-temporary impairments) are reflected OCI. All other investments, excluding those accounted for using the equity method, are recorded cost. lend certain fixed income and equity securities enhance investment income. Collateral and security interest determined based upon the underlying security and the creditworthiness the borrower. The fair value collateral that are permitted sell repledge was $ million both June , and .

Once decline fair value determined other-than-temporary, impairment charge recorded and new cost basis the investment established. use derivative instruments manage exposures foreign currency, security price, interest rate, and credit risks. Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the impact these exposures effectively possible. Foreign Currency Risk. Certain forecasted transactions and assets are exposed foreign currency risk. monitor our foreign currency exposures daily maximize the overall effectiveness our foreign currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include the Euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Non . dollar denominated securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated fair value hedging instruments under SFAS . Options used hedge portion forecasted international revenue for three years the future are designated cash flow hedging instruments. Certain options and forwards not designated hedging instruments under SFAS are also used hedge the impact the variability exchange rates accounts receivable and collections denominated certain foreign currencies. Securities Price Risk. Strategic equity investments are subject market price risk. From time time, use and designate options hedge fair values and cash flows certain equity securities. determine the security, forecasted sale thereof, selected for hedging market conditions, -front costs, and other relevant factors. Once established, the hedges are not dynamically managed traded, and are generally not removed until maturity. Interest Rate Risk. Fixed-income securities are subject interest rate risk. The fixed-income portfolio diversified and consists primarily investment grade securities minimize credit risk. use exchange-traded option and future contracts, not designated hedging instruments under SFAS , hedge interest rate risk. addition, routinely use options, not designated hedging instruments under SFAS , hedge our exposure interest rate risk the event catastrophic increase interest rates. Other Derivatives. Swap contracts, not designated hedging instruments under SFAS , are used manage exposures credit risks. addition, may invest warrants purchase securities other companies strategic investment. Warrants that can net share settled are deemed derivative financial instruments and are not designated hedging instruments. Announced forward purchase commitments mortgage-backed assets are also considered derivatives cases where physical delivery the assets are not taken the earliest available delivery date. For options designated either fair value cash flow hedges, changes the time value are excluded from the assessment hedge effectiveness. / MSFT FORM - Part , Item Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate probable losses inherent the account receivable balance. determine the allowance based known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity the allowance for doubtful accounts follows: ( millions) Year Ended June Balance beginning period Charged costs and expenses Write-offs and other Balance end period $ $ $ $ Inventories Inventories are stated the lower cost market, using the average cost method. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related the purchase and production inventories. Property and Equipment Property and equipment stated cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter the estimated life the asset the lease term, ranging from one years. Computer software developed obtained for internal use depreciated using the straight-line method over the estimated useful life the software, generally three years less. Goodwill Beginning fiscal with the adoption SFAS , Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets, goodwill longer amortized, but instead tested for impairment least annually. Prior fiscal , goodwill was amortized using the straight-line method over its estimated period benefit. Intangible Assets Intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period benefit, ranging from one ten years. periodically evaluate the recoverability intangible assets and take into account events circumstances that warrant revised estimates useful lives that indicate that impairment exists. All our intangible assets are subject amortization. Employee Stock Plans follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion , Accounting for Stock Issued Employees, account for stock option and employee stock purchase plans, which generally does not require income statement recognition options granted the market price the date issuance. However, certain events, such the accelerated vesting options and the exchange options business combination, can trigger recording expense. addition announcing changes our employee compensation arrangements July , also indicated that will adopt the fair value recognition provisions SFAS , Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation, effective July , and will report that change accounting principle using the retroactive restatement method described SFAS , Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation \x96 Transition and Disclosure .
