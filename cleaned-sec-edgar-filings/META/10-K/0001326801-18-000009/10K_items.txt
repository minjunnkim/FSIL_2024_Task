Risks Related Our Business and Industry fail retain existing users add new users, our users decrease their level engagement with our products, our revenue, financial results, and business may significantly harmed. The size our user base and our users\' level engagement are critical our success. Our financial performance has been and will continue significantly determined our success adding, retaining, and engaging active users our products, particularly for Facebook and Instagram. anticipate that our active user growth rate will continue decline over time the size our active user base increases, and possible that the size our active user base may fluctuate decline one more markets, particularly markets where have achieved higher penetration rates. For example, the fourth quarter , experienced slight decline quarter-over-quarter basis the number daily active users Facebook the United States & Canada region. people not perceive our products useful, reliable, and trustworthy, may not able attract retain users otherwise maintain increase the frequency and duration their engagement. number other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases levels engagement decline, some cases precipitously. There guarantee that will not experience similar erosion our active user base engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can difficult measure, particularly introduce new and different products and services. Any number factors could potentially negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including : • users increasingly engage with other competitive products services; • fail introduce new features, products services that users find engaging introduce new products services, make changes existing products and services, that are not favorably received; • users feel that their experience diminished result the decisions make with respect the frequency, prominence, format, size, and quality ads that display; • users have difficulty installing, updating, otherwise accessing our products mobile devices result actions third parties that rely distribute our products and deliver our services; • user behavior any our products changes, including decreases the quality and frequency content shared our products and services; • are unable continue develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with variety mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve high level market acceptance; • there are decreases user sentiment about the quality usefulness our products concerns related privacy and sharing, safety, security, other factors; • are unable manage and prioritize information ensure users are presented with content that appropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant them; • are unable obtain attract engaging third-party content; • users adopt new technologies where our products may displaced favor other products services, may not featured otherwise available; • there are adverse changes our products that are mandated legislation, regulatory authorities, litigation; • there decreased engagement acceptance product features our service, decreased acceptance our terms service, part changes that may implemented connection with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Europe; • technical other problems prevent from delivering our products rapid and reliable manner otherwise affect the user experience, such security breaches failure prevent limit spam similar content; • adopt terms, policies, procedures related areas such sharing, content, user data, advertising that are perceived negatively our users the general public; • elect focus our product decisions longer-term initiatives that not prioritize near-term user growth and engagement, initiatives designed attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful discontinued, whether result actions , third parties, otherwise; • fail provide adequate customer service users, marketers, developers, other partners; • , developers whose products are integrated with our products, other partners and companies our industry are the subject adverse media reports other negative publicity; • our current future products, such our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers build, grow, and monetize mobile and web applications, reduce user activity our products making easier for our users interact and share third-party mobile and web applications. are unable maintain increase our user base and user engagement, our revenue and financial results may adversely affected. Any decrease user retention, growth, engagement could render our products less attractive users, marketers, and developers, which likely have material and adverse impact our revenue, business, financial condition, and results operations. our active user growth rate continues slow, will become increasingly dependent our ability maintain increase levels user engagement and monetization order drive revenue growth. generate substantially all our revenue from advertising. The loss marketers, reduction spending marketers, could seriously harm our business. Substantially all our revenue currently generated from third parties advertising Facebook and Instagram. For , , and , advertising accounted for % , % and % , respectively, our revenue. common the industry, our marketers not have long-term advertising commitments with . Many our marketers spend only relatively small portion their overall advertising budget with .

The substantial majority our revenue generated from advertising mobile devices. There guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue feature Facebook our other products, that mobile device users will continue use our products rather than competing products. are dependent the interoperability Facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that not control, such the Android and iOS operating systems. Any changes, bugs, technical issues such systems, changes our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, their terms service policies that degrade our products\' functionality, reduce eliminate our ability distribute our products, give preferential treatment competitive products, limit our ability deliver, target, measure the effectiveness ads, charge fees related the distribution our products our delivery ads could adversely affect the usage Facebook our other products and monetization mobile devices. Additionally, order deliver high quality mobile products, important that our products work well with range mobile technologies, systems, networks, and standards that not control, and that have good relationships with handset manufacturers and mobile carriers. may not successful maintaining developing relationships with key participants the mobile ecosystem developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, systems, networks, standards. the event that more difficult for our users access and use Facebook our other products their mobile devices, our users choose not access use Facebook our other products their mobile devices use mobile products that not offer access Facebook our other products, our user growth and user engagement could harmed.

For example, Google has integrated social functionality into number its products, including search, video, and Android. also compete with companies that develop applications, particularly mobile applications, that provide social other communications functionality, such messaging, photo- and video-sharing, and micro-blogging, well companies that provide regional social networks that have strong positions particular countries. addition, face competition from traditional, online, and mobile businesses that provide media for marketers reach their audiences and develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. also compete with companies that develop and deliver virtual reality products and services. Some our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources stronger competitive positions certain product segments, geographic regions, user demographics than . These factors may allow our competitors respond more effectively than new emerging technologies and changes market conditions. believe that some users, particularly younger users, are aware and actively engaging with other products and services similar , substitute for, Facebook products and services, and believe that some users have reduced their use and engagement with our products and services favor these other products and services. the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services, may experience decline use and engagement key user demographics more broadly, which case our business would likely harmed. Our competitors may develop products, features, services that are similar ours that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts marketing campaigns, may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. addition, developers whose mobile and web applications are integrated with Facebook our other products may use information shared our users through our products order develop products features that compete with . Some competitors may gain competitive advantage against areas where operate, including: integrating competing platforms, applications, features into products they control such mobile device operating systems, search engines, web browsers; making acquisitions; limiting our ability deliver, target, measure the effectiveness ads; imposing fees other charges related our delivery ads; making access our products more difficult; making more difficult communicate with our users. result, our competitors may acquire and engage users generate advertising other revenue the expense our own efforts, which may negatively affect our business and financial results. addition, from time time, may take actions response competitive threats, but cannot assure you that these actions will successful that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results. believe that our ability compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including: • the popularity, usefulness, ease use, performance, and reliability our products compared our competitors\' products; • the size and composition our user base; • the engagement users with our products and competing products; • the timing and market acceptance products, including developments and enhancements our our competitors\' products; • our ability distribute our products new and existing users; • our ability monetize our products; • the frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence the ads displayed our competitors; • customer service and support efforts; • marketing and selling efforts, including our ability measure the effectiveness our ads and provide marketers with compelling return their investments; • our ability establish and maintain developers\' interest building mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products; • our ability establish and maintain publisher interest integrating their content with Facebook and our other products; • changes mandated legislation, regulatory authorities, litigation, some which may have disproportionate effect ; • acquisitions consolidation within our industry, which may result more formidable competitors; • our ability attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and product managers; • our ability cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and • our reputation and brand strength relative those our competitors. are not able compete effectively, our user base and level user engagement may decrease, may become less attractive developers and marketers, and our revenue and results operations may materially and adversely affected. Action governments restrict access Facebook our other products their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results. possible that governments one more countries may seek censor content available Facebook our other products their country, restrict access our products from their country entirely, impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility our products their country for extended period time indefinitely. For example, user access Facebook and certain our other products has been currently restricted whole part China, Iran, and North Korea. addition, government authorities other countries may seek restrict user access our products they consider violation their laws threat public safety for other reasons, and certain our products have been restricted governments other countries from time time. also possible that government authorities could take action restrict our ability sell advertising. the event that content shown Facebook our other products subject censorship, access our products restricted, whole part, one more countries, other restrictions are imposed our products, our competitors are able successfully penetrate new geographic markets capture greater share existing geographic markets that cannot access where face other restrictions, our ability retain increase our user base, user engagement, the level advertising marketers may adversely affected, may not able maintain grow our revenue anticipated, and our financial results could adversely affected. Our new products and changes existing products could fail attract retain users generate revenue and profits. Our ability retain, increase, and engage our user base and increase our revenue depends heavily our ability continue evolve our existing products and create successful new products, both independently and conjunction with developers other third parties. may introduce significant changes our existing products acquire introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which have little prior development operating experience. For example, March , shipped our first virtual reality hardware product, the Oculus Rift. addition, have announced plans develop augmented reality technology and products. not have significant experience with consumer hardware products virtual augmented reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability successfully develop and market these products and technologies, and will incur increased costs connection with the development and marketing such products and technologies. have also invested, and expect continue invest, significant resources growing our WhatsApp and Messenger products. have historically monetized messaging only very limited fashion, and may not successful our efforts generate meaningful revenue from messaging over the long term. these other new enhanced products fail engage users, marketers, developers, are unsuccessful our monetization efforts, may fail attract retain users generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, other value justify our investments, and our business may adversely affected. make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that expect. frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, from time time may change the size, frequency, relative prominence ads order improve quality and overall user experience. Similarly, recently announced changes our News Feed ranking algorithm help our users have more meaningful social interactions, and expect that these changes will have the effect reducing time spent and some measures user engagement with Facebook, which could adversely affect our financial results. From time time, have also made, and expect continue make, other changes our products which may adversely affect the distribution content publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive invest their efforts Facebook. also may introduce new features other changes existing products, introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, use cases where have more proven means monetization. For example, the Stories format becoming increasingly popular for sharing content across our products, and not currently monetize Stories the same rate News Feed. addition, plan continue focusing growing users and engagement Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp, and may also introduce other stand-alone applications the future. These efforts may reduce engagement with the core Facebook application, where have the most proven means monetization and which serves the platform for many our new user experiences. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that expect. are not able maintain and enhance our brands, events occur that damage our reputation and brands, our ability expand our base users, marketers, and developers may impaired, and our business and financial results may harmed. believe that our brands have significantly contributed the success our business. also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands critical expanding our base users, marketers, and developers. Many our new users are referred existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely our ability continue provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which may not successfully. may introduce new products terms service policies that users not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions our developers advertisers may affect our brands users not have positive experience using third-party mobile and web applications integrated with our products interacting with parties that advertise through our products. will also continue experience media, legislative, regulatory scrutiny our decisions regarding user privacy, content, advertising, and other issues, which may adversely affect our reputation and brands. For example, previously announced our discovery certain ads and other content previously displayed our products that may relevant government investigations relating Russian interference the . presidential election. also may fail respond expeditiously the sharing objectionable content our services objectionable practices advertisers, otherwise address user concerns, which could erode confidence our brands. Our brands may also negatively affected the actions users that are deemed hostile inappropriate other users, the actions users acting under false inauthentic identities, the use our products services disseminate information that deemed misleading ( intended manipulate opinions), perceived actual efforts governments obtain access user information for security-related purposes censor certain content our platform, the use our products services for illicit, objectionable, illegal ends. Maintaining and enhancing our brands may require make substantial investments and these investments may not successful. Certain our past actions have eroded confidence our brands, and fail successfully promote and maintain our brands incur excessive expenses this effort, our business and financial results may adversely affected. Security breaches and improper access disclosure our data user data, other hacking and phishing attacks our systems, could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business. Our industry prone cyber-attacks third parties seeking unauthorized access our data users’ data disrupt our ability provide service. Any failure prevent mitigate security breaches and improper access disclosure our data user data, including personal information, content payment information from users, could result the loss misuse such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), and general hacking have become more prevalent our industry, have occurred our systems the past, and will occur our systems the future. also regularly encounter attempts create false undesirable user accounts, purchase ads, take other actions our platform for purposes such spamming, spreading misinformation, other objectionable ends. result our prominence, the size our user base, and the types and volume personal data our systems, believe that are particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks. Such attacks may cause interruptions the services provide, degrade the user experience, cause users lose confidence and trust our products, impair our internal systems, result financial harm . Our efforts protect our company data the information receive may also unsuccessful due software bugs other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, vendor error malfeasance; government surveillance; other threats that evolve. addition, third parties may attempt fraudulently induce employees users disclose information order gain access our data our users\' data. Cyber-attacks continue evolve sophistication and volume, and inherently may difficult detect for long periods time. Although have developed systems and processes that are designed protect our data and user data, prevent data loss, disable undesirable accounts and activities our platform, and prevent detect security breaches, cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, and may incur significant costs protecting against remediating cyber-attacks. addition, some our developers other partners, such those that help measure the effectiveness ads, may receive store information provided our users through mobile web applications integrated with Facebook. provide limited information such third parties based the scope services provided . However, these third parties developers fail adopt adhere adequate data security practices, the event breach their networks, our data our users\' data may improperly accessed, used, disclosed. Affected users government authorities could initiate legal regulatory actions against connection with any security breaches improper disclosure data, which could cause incur significant expense and liability result orders consent decrees forcing modify our business practices. Such incidents may also result decline our active user base engagement levels. Any these events could have material and adverse effect our business, reputation, financial results. Unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business. receive high degree media coverage around the world. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, terms service, product changes, product quality, litigation regulatory activity, government surveillance, the actions our advertisers, the actions our developers whose products are integrated with our products, the use our products services for illicit, objectionable, illegal ends, the actions our users, the quality and integrity content shared our platform, the actions other companies that provide similar services , has the past, and could the future, adversely affect our reputation. Such negative publicity also could have adverse effect the size, engagement, and loyalty our user base and result decreased revenue, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our financial results will fluctuate from quarter quarter and are difficult predict. Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated the past and will fluctuate the future. Additionally, have limited operating history with the current scale our business, which makes difficult forecast our future results. result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results indicators future performance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered companies rapidly evolving markets. Our financial results any given quarter can influenced numerous factors, many which are unable predict are outside our control, including: • our ability maintain and grow our user base and user engagement; • our ability attract and retain marketers particular period; • fluctuations spending our marketers due seasonality, such historically strong spending the fourth quarter each year, episodic regional global events, other factors; • the frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality ads shown users; • the success technologies designed block the display ads; • the pricing our ads and other products; • the diversification and growth revenue sources beyond advertising Facebook and Instagram; • our ability generate revenue from Payments, the sale Oculus products and services other products may introduce the future; • the development and introduction new products services our competitors; • user behavior product changes that may reduce traffic features products that successfully monetize; • increases marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that will incur grow and expand our operations and remain competitive; • costs and expenses related the development and delivery Oculus products and services; • our ability maintain gross margins and operating margins; • costs related acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments develop the acquired technologies; • charges associated with impairment any assets our balance sheet; • our ability obtain equipment, components, and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure timely and cost-effective manner; • system failures outages, which could prevent from serving ads for any period time; • breaches security privacy, and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation; • changes the manner which distribute our products inaccessibility our products due third-party actions; • fees paid third parties for content the distribution our products; • share-based compensation expense, including acquisition-related expense; • adverse litigation judgments, settlements, other litigation-related costs; • changes the legislative regulatory environment, including with respect privacy and data protection, enforcement government regulators, including fines, orders, consent decrees; • the overall tax rate for our business, which may affected the mix income earn the . and jurisdictions with comparatively lower tax rates, the effects share-based compensation, the effects integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, and the effects changes our business; • the impact changes tax law, which are recorded the period enacted and may significantly affect the effective tax rate that period; • tax obligations that may arise from resolutions tax examinations, including the examination are currently under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that materially differ from the amounts have anticipated; • fluctuations currency exchange rates and changes the proportion our revenue and expenses denominated foreign currencies; • fluctuations the market values our portfolio investments and interest rates; • changes . generally accepted accounting principles; and • changes global business macroeconomic conditions. expect our rates growth decline the future. expect that our user growth and revenue growth rates will decline over time the size our active user base increases, and possible that the size our active user base may fluctuate decline one more markets, particularly achieve greater market penetration. expect our revenue growth rate will generally decline over time our revenue increases higher levels. our growth rates decline, investors\' perceptions our business may adversely affected and the trading price our Class common stock could decline. Our costs are continuing grow, which could reduce our operating margin and profitability. our investments are not successful, our business and financial performance could harmed. Operating our business costly, and expect our expenses continue increase the future broaden our user base, users increase the amount and types content they consume and the data they share with , for example with respect video, develop and implement new products, continue expand our technical infrastructure, continue invest new and unproven technologies, and continue hire additional employees support our expanding operations. will continue invest our messaging, security, video content, and global connectivity efforts, well other initiatives that may not have clear paths monetization. addition, will incur increased costs connection with the development and marketing our Oculus products and services. Any such investments may not successful, and any such increases our costs may reduce our operating margin and profitability. addition, our investments are not successful, our ability grow revenue will harmed, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Given our levels share-based compensation, our tax rate may vary significantly depending our stock price. The tax effects the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period period. periods which our stock price higher than the grant price the share-based compensation vesting that period, will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our effective tax rate. For example, , excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes $ billion and our effective tax rate six percentage points compared the tax rate without such benefits. future periods which our stock price lower than the grant price the share-based compensation vesting that period, our effective tax rate may increase. The amount and value share-based compensation issued relative our earnings particular period will also affect the magnitude the impact share-based compensation our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent our stock price, which not control, and decline our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results. Our business subject complex and evolving . and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other matters. Many these laws and regulations are subject change and uncertain interpretation, and could result claims, changes our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost operations, declines user growth engagement, otherwise harm our business. are subject variety laws and regulations the United States and abroad that involve matters central our business, including privacy, data protection and personal information, rights publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic other trade prohibitions sanctions, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction new products, expansion our activities certain jurisdictions, other actions that may take may subject additional laws, regulations, other government scrutiny. addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations more restrictive than those the United States. These . federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which some cases can enforced private parties addition government entities, are constantly evolving and can subject significant change. result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly the new and rapidly evolving industry which operate, and may interpreted and applied inconsistently from country country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory legislative actions affecting the manner which display content our users obtain consent various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the manner which provide our services adversely affect our financial results. are also subject laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances can transfer, process and receive certain data that critical our operations, including data shared between countries regions which operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, , the European Union and United States agreed alternative transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but this new framework subject annual review that could result changes our obligations and also may challenged national regulators private parties. addition, the other bases upon which Facebook relies legitimize the transfer such data, such standard Model Contractual Clauses (MCCs), have been subjected regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner has challenged the legal grounds for transfers user data Facebook, Inc., and the Irish High Court has agreed refer this challenge the Court Justice the European Union for decision. also face multiple inquiries, investigations, and lawsuits Europe, India, and other jurisdictions regarding the August update WhatsApp’ terms service and privacy policy and its sharing certain data with other Facebook products and services, including lawsuit currently pending before the Supreme Court India. one more the legal bases for transferring data from Europe the United States invalidated, are unable transfer data between and among countries and regions which operate, are prohibited from sharing data among our products and services, could affect the manner which provide our services adversely affect our financial results. Proposed new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. There currently are number proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies. addition, the new European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) will take effect May and will apply all our products and services that provide service Europe. The GDPR will include operational requirements for companies that receive process personal data residents the European Union that are different than those currently place the European Union. For example, may required implement measures change our service limit access our service for minors under the age for certain countries Europe that maintain the minimum age under the GDPR. may also required obtain consent and offer new controls existing and new users Europe before processing data for certain aspects our service. addition, the GDPR will include significant penalties for non-compliance. Similarly, there are number legislative proposals the United States, both the federal and state level, that could impose new obligations areas affecting our business, such liability for copyright infringement third parties. addition, some countries are considering have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements requiring local storage and processing data similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity delivering our services. These laws and regulations, well any associated inquiries investigations any other government actions, may costly comply with and may delay impede the development new products, result negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject remedies that may harm our business, including fines demands orders that modify cease existing business practices. have been subject regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and expect continue subject such proceedings and other inquires the future, which could cause incur substantial costs require change our business practices manner materially adverse our business. From time time, receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations, many which are evolving and subject interpretation. are and expect continue the subject investigations, inquiries, data requests, actions, and audits the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly the areas privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, and competition, continue grow and expand our operations. For example, several data protection authorities the European Union have initiated actions, investigations, administrative orders seeking assert jurisdiction over Facebook, Inc. and our subsidiaries and restrict the ways which collect and use information, and other data protection authorities may the same. Orders issued , inquiries enforcement actions initiated , government regulatory authorities could cause incur substantial costs, expose unanticipated civil and criminal liability penalties (including substantial monetary fines), require change our business practices manner materially adverse our business. are unable protect our intellectual property, the value our brands and other intangible assets may diminished, and our business may adversely affected. rely and expect continue rely combination confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom have relationships, well trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, protect our proprietary rights. the United States and internationally, have filed various applications for protection certain aspects our intellectual property, and currently hold significant number registered trademarks and issued patents multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third parties may knowingly unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held , and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not approved. addition, effective intellectual property protection may not available every country which operate intend operate our business. any all these cases, may required expend significant time and expense order prevent infringement enforce our rights. Although have generally taken measures protect our proprietary rights, there can assurance that others will not offer products concepts that are substantially similar ours and compete with our business. addition, regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology developed available under other open licenses, and include open source software our products. For example, have contributed certain specifications and designs related our data center equipment the Open Compute Project Foundation, non-profit entity that shares and develops such information with the technology community, under the Open Web Foundation License. result our open source contributions and the use open source our products, may license required license disclose code and innovations that turn out material our business and may also exposed increased litigation risk. the protection our proprietary rights inadequate prevent unauthorized use appropriation third parties, the value our brands and other intangible assets may diminished and competitors may able more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods operations. Any these events could have adverse effect our business and financial results. are currently, and expect the future, party patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and, resolved adversely, could have significant impact our business, financial condition, results operations. Companies the Internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based allegations infringement, misappropriation, other violations intellectual property other rights. addition, various "non-practicing entities" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt aggressively assert their rights order extract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time time may introduce acquire new products, including areas where historically have not competed, which could increase our exposure patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities. From time time, receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain our products and services, user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. presently are involved number intellectual property lawsuits, and face increasing competition and gain increasingly high profile, expect the number patent and other intellectual property claims against grow. Defending patent and other intellectual property litigation costly and can impose significant burden management and employees, and there can assurances that favorable final outcomes will obtained all cases. addition, plaintiffs may seek, and may become subject , preliminary provisional rulings the course any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring cease some all our operations. may decide settle such lawsuits and disputes terms that are unfavorable . Similarly, any litigation which are party resolved adversely, may subject unfavorable judgment that may not reversed upon appeal. The terms such settlement judgment may require cease some all our operations pay substantial amounts the other party. addition, may have seek license continue practices found violation third party\' rights, which may not available reasonable terms, all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. result, may also required develop alternative non-infringing technology practices discontinue the practices. The development alternative non-infringing technology practices could require significant effort and expense may not feasible. Our business, financial condition, and results operations could adversely affected result unfavorable resolution the disputes and litigation referred above. are involved numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, and, resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, results operations. addition intellectual property claims, are also involved numerous other lawsuits, including putative class action lawsuits, many which claim statutory damages and seek significant changes our business operations, and anticipate that will continue target for numerous lawsuits the future. Because the scale our user base, the plaintiffs class action cases filed against typically claim enormous monetary damages even the alleged per-user harm small non-existent. addition, may subject additional class action lawsuits based employment claims, product performance other claims related the use consumer hardware and software, well virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. Any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result payments substantial monetary damages fines, undesirable changes our products business practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, results operations could materially and adversely affected. Although the results such lawsuits and claims cannot predicted with certainty, not believe that the final outcome those matters relating our products that currently face will have material adverse effect our business, financial condition, results operations. addition, are currently the subject stockholder class action suits connection with our initial public offering (IPO). believe these lawsuits are without merit and are vigorously defending these lawsuits. There can assurances that favorable final outcome will obtained all our cases, and defending any lawsuit costly and can impose significant burden management and employees. Any litigation which are party may result onerous unfavorable judgment that may not reversed upon appeal payments substantial monetary damages fines, may decide settle lawsuits similarly unfavorable terms, which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results operations. may incur liability result information retrieved from transmitted over the Internet published using our products result claims related our products. have faced, currently face, and will continue face claims relating information that published made available our products. particular, the nature our business exposes claims related defamation, dissemination misinformation news hoaxes, discrimination, intellectual property rights, rights publicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws regulating hate speech other types content. This risk enhanced certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may unclear where may less protected under local laws than are the United States. addition, there have been various Congressional efforts restrict the scope the protections available online platforms under Section the Communications Decency Act, and our current protections from liability for third-party content the United States could decrease change. could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, are found liable, significant damages. could also face fines orders restricting blocking our services particular geographies result content hosted our services. For example, recently enacted legislation Germany may impose significant fines for failure comply with certain content removal and disclosure obligations. any these events occur, our business and financial results could adversely affected. Our CEO has control over key decision making result his control majority the voting power our outstanding capital stock. Mark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, able exercise voting rights with respect majority the voting power our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability control the outcome matters submitted our stockholders for approval, including the election directors and any merger, consolidation, sale all substantially all our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, prevent change control, merger, consolidation, sale all substantially all our assets that our other stockholders support, conversely this concentrated control could result the consummation such transaction that our other stockholders not support. This concentrated control could also discourage potential investor from acquiring our Class common stock, which has limited voting power relative the Class common stock, and might harm the trading price our Class common stock. addition, . Zuckerberg has the ability control the management and major strategic investments our company result his position our CEO and his ability control the election replacement our directors. the event his death, the shares our capital stock that . Zuckerberg owns will transferred the persons entities that has designated. board member and officer, . Zuckerberg owes fiduciary duty our stockholders and must act good faith manner reasonably believes the best interests our stockholders. stockholder, even controlling stockholder, . Zuckerberg entitled vote his shares, and shares over which has voting control governed voting agreement, his own interests, which may not always the interests our stockholders generally. plan continue make acquisitions, which could harm our financial condition results operations and may adversely affect the price our common stock. part our business strategy, have made and intend continue make acquisitions add specialized employees and complementary companies, products, technologies. may not able find suitable acquisition candidates, and may not able complete acquisitions favorable terms, all. some cases, the costs such acquisitions may substantial. For example, paid approximately $ billion cash and issued million shares our Class common stock connection with our acquisition WhatsApp, and paid approximately $ million cash and issued million shares our Class common stock connection with our acquisition Oculus. also issued substantial number RSUs help retain the employees these companies. There assurance that will receive favorable return investment for these other acquisitions. may pay substantial amounts cash incur debt pay for acquisitions, which could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence indebtedness would also result increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants other restrictions that would impede our ability manage our operations. may also issue equity securities pay for acquisitions and regularly grant RSUs retain the employees acquired companies, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and result dilution our stockholders. addition, any acquisitions announce could viewed negatively users, marketers, developers, investors, which may adversely affect our business the price our Class common stock. may also discover liabilities deficiencies associated with the companies assets acquire that were not identified advance, which may result significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness our due diligence review and our ability evaluate the results such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness statements and disclosures made actions taken the companies acquire their representatives, well the limited amount time which acquisitions are executed. addition, may fail accurately forecast the financial impact acquisition transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions may also result our recording significant additional expenses our results operations and recording substantial finite-lived intangible assets our balance sheet upon closing. Any these factors may adversely affect our financial condition results operations. may not able successfully integrate our acquisitions, and may incur significant costs integrate and support the companies acquire. The integration acquisitions requires significant time and resources, and may not manage these processes successfully. Our ability successfully integrate complex acquisitions unproven, particularly with respect companies that have significant operations that develop products where not have prior experience. For example, Oculus and WhatsApp are larger and more complex than companies have historically acquired. particular, Oculus builds technology and products that are relatively new Facebook and with which did not have significant experience structure place support prior the acquisition. continue make substantial investments resources support these acquisitions, which will result significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas our business. cannot assure you that these investments will successful. fail successfully integrate the companies acquire, may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may harmed. our goodwill finite-lived intangible assets become impaired, may required record significant charge earnings. review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events changes circumstances indicate the carrying value may not recoverable, such decline stock price and market capitalization. test goodwill for impairment least annually. such goodwill finite-lived intangible assets are deemed impaired, impairment loss equal the amount which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value the assets would recognized. may required record significant charge our financial statements during the period which any impairment our goodwill finite-lived intangible assets determined, which would negatively affect our results operations. Our business dependent our ability maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption our service could damage our reputation, result potential loss users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results. Our reputation and ability attract, retain, and serve our users dependent upon the reliable performance our products and our underlying technical infrastructure. have the past experienced, and may the future experience, interruptions the availability performance our products from time time. Our systems may not adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy avoid performance delays outages that could harmful our business. our products are unavailable when users attempt access them, they not load quickly expected, users may not use our products often the future, all, and our ability serve ads may disrupted. our user base and engagement continue grow, and the amount and types information shared Facebook and our other products continue grow and evolve, such increased engagement with video, will need increasing amount technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, continue satisfy the needs our users and advertisers. possible that may fail continue effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue growth. addition, our business may subject interruptions, delays, failures resulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, cyber-attacks, other catastrophic events. such event were occur, users may subject service disruptions outages and may not able recover our technical infrastructure and user data timely manner restart provide our services, which may adversely affect our financial results. substantial portion our network infrastructure provided third parties. Any disruption failure the services receive from these providers could harm our ability handle existing increased traffic and could significantly harm our business. Any financial other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business, and exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability problems with the services they provide. could experience unforeseen difficulties building and operating key portions our technical infrastructure. have designed and built our own data centers and key portions our technical infrastructure through which serve our products, and plan continue significantly expand the size our infrastructure primarily through data centers and other projects. The infrastructure expansion are undertaking complex and involves projects multiple locations, and unanticipated delays the completion these projects, including due any shortage labor necessary building portions such projects, availability components, may lead increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions the delivery degradation the quality our products. addition, there may issues related this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases design and implementation, which may only become evident after have started fully utilize the underlying equipment, that could further degrade the user experience increase our costs. Our products and internal systems rely software that highly technical, and contains undetected errors vulnerabilities, our business could adversely affected. Our products and internal systems rely software, including software developed maintained internally and third parties, that highly technical and complex. addition, our products and internal systems depend the ability such software store, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts data. The software which rely has contained, and will the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, vulnerabilities. Some errors may only discovered after the code has been released for external internal use. Errors, vulnerabilities, other design defects within the software which rely have the past, and may the future, result negative experience for users and marketers who use our products, delay product introductions enhancements, result targeting, measurement, billing errors, compromise our ability protect the data our users and our intellectual property lead reductions our ability provide some all our services. addition, any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, defects discovered the software which rely, and any associated degradations interruptions service, could result damage our reputation, loss users, loss revenue, liability for damages, any which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Technologies have been developed that can block the display our ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. Technologies have been developed, and will likely continue developed, that can block the display our ads block our measurement tools, particularly for advertising displayed personal computers. generate substantially all our revenue from advertising, including revenue resulting from the display ads personal computers. Revenue generated from the display ads personal computers has been impacted these technologies from time time. result, these technologies have had adverse effect our financial results and, such technologies continue proliferate, particular with respect mobile platforms, our future financial results may harmed. Real perceived inaccuracies our user and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. The numbers for our key metrics, which include our DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), are calculated using internal company data based the activity user accounts. While these numbers are based what believe reasonable estimates our user base for the applicable period measurement, there are inherent challenges measuring usage our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. addition, are continually seeking improve our estimates our user base, and such estimates may change due improvements changes our methodology. regularly evaluate these metrics estimate the number "duplicate" and "false" accounts among our MAUs. duplicate account one that user maintains addition his her principal account. divide "false" accounts into two categories: ( ) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles for business, organization, non-human entity such pet (such entities are permitted Facebook using Page rather than personal profile under our terms service); and ( ) undesirable accounts, which represent user profiles that determine are intended used for purposes that violate our terms service, such spamming. The estimates duplicate and false accounts are based internal review limited sample accounts, and apply significant judgment making this determination. For example, identify duplicate accounts use data signals such similar addresses user names, and identify false accounts look for names that appear fake other behavior that appears inauthentic the reviewers. Our estimates may change our methodologies evolve, including through the application new data signals technologies, which may allow identify previously undetected duplicate false accounts and may improve our ability evaluate broader population our users. such, our estimation duplicate false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number such accounts. particular, duplicate accounts are very difficult measure our scale, and possible that the actual number duplicate accounts may vary significantly from our estimates. the fourth quarter , estimate that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately % our worldwide MAUs. believe the percentage duplicate accounts meaningfully higher developing markets such India, Indonesia, and the Philippines, compared more developed markets. the fourth quarter , estimate that false accounts may have represented approximately - % our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation false accounts can vary result episodic spikes the creation such accounts, which have seen originate more frequently specific countries such Indonesia, Turkey, and Vietnam. From time time, may make product changes take other actions reduce the number duplicate false accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates particular period. Our data limitations may affect our understanding certain details our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates decline usage among younger users, this age data unreliable because disproportionate number our younger users register with inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding usage age group may not complete. addition, our data regarding the geographic location our users estimated based number factors, such the user\' address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user\' actual location. For example, user may appear accessing Facebook from the location the proxy server that the user connects rather than from the user\' actual location. The methodologies used measure user metrics may also susceptible algorithm other technical errors. Our estimates for revenue user location and revenue user device are also affected these factors. regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time time may discover inaccuracies our metrics make adjustments improve their accuracy, including adjustments that may result the recalculation our historical metrics. believe that any such inaccuracies adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated. intend disclose our estimates the number duplicate and false accounts among our MAUs annual basis. addition, our DAU and MAU estimates will differ from estimates published third parties due differences methodology. addition, from time time provide, rely , certain other metrics, including those relating the reach and effectiveness our ads. All our metrics are subject software bugs, inconsistencies our systems, and human error. marketers, developers, investors not perceive our metrics accurate, discover material inaccuracies our metrics, may subject liability, our reputation may harmed, and marketers and developers may less willing allocate their budgets resources Facebook, which could negatively affect our business and financial results. cannot assure you that will effectively manage our growth. Our employee headcount and the scope and complexity our business have increased significantly, with the number employees increasing , December , from , December , , and expect such headcount growth continue for the foreseeable future. The growth and expansion our business and products create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users, marketers, developers, and other third parties. our operations and the number our third-party relationships continue grow, our information technology systems our internal controls and procedures may not adequate support such growth. addition, some members our management not have significant experience managing large global business operation, our management may not able manage such growth effectively. effectively manage our growth, must continue improve our operational, financial, and management processes and systems and effectively expand, train, and manage our employee base. our organization continues grow, and are required implement more complex organizational management structures, may find increasingly difficult maintain the benefits our corporate culture, including our ability quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance. The loss one more our key personnel, our failure attract and retain other highly qualified personnel the future, could harm our business. currently depend the continued services and performance our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl . Sandberg. Although have entered into employment agreements with . Zuckerberg and . Sandberg, the agreements have specific duration and constitute -will employment. addition, many our key technologies and systems are custom-made for our business our personnel. The loss key personnel, including members management well key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our operations and have adverse effect our business. continue grow, cannot guarantee will continue attract and retain the personnel need maintain our competitive position. particular, intend continue hire significant number technical personnel the foreseeable future, and expect continue face significant competition from other companies hiring such personnel, particularly the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located and where the cost living high. continue mature, the incentives attract, retain, and motivate employees provided our equity awards future arrangements may not effective the past, and issue significant equity attract additional employees retain our existing employees, would incur substantial additional share-based compensation expense and the ownership our existing stockholders would further diluted. Our ability attract, retain, and motivate employees may also adversely affected stock price volatility. Additionally, have number current employees whose equity ownership our company has provided them substantial amount personal wealth, which could affect their decisions about whether not continue work for . result these factors, may difficult for continue retain and motivate our employees. not succeed attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, retaining and motivating existing personnel, may unable grow effectively. may not able continue successfully grow usage and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products. have made and are continuing make investments enable developers build, grow, and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products. Such existing and prospective developers may not successful building, growing, monetizing mobile and web applications that create and maintain user engagement. Additionally, developers may choose build other platforms, including mobile platforms controlled third parties, rather than building products that integrate with Facebook and our other products. are continuously seeking balance the distribution objectives our developers with our desire provide optimal user experience, and may not successful achieving balance that continues attract and retain such developers. For example, from time time, have taken actions reduce the volume communications from these developers users Facebook and our other products with the objective enhancing the user experience, and such actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization opportunities from, mobile and web applications integrated with our products. some instances, these actions, well other actions enforce our policies applicable developers, have adversely affected our relationships with such developers. are not successful our efforts continue grow the number developers that choose build products that integrate with Facebook and our other products are unable continue build and maintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may adversely affected. currently generate substantially all our Payments revenue from developers that use Facebook personal computers, and expect that our Payments revenue will continue decline usage Facebook personal computers continues decline. currently generate substantially all our Payments revenue from developers that use Facebook personal computers. Specifically, applications built developers social games are currently responsible for substantially all our revenue derived from Payments, and the majority the revenue from these applications has historically been generated limited number the most popular games. have experienced and expect see the continued decline usage Facebook personal computers, which expect will result continuing decline Payments revenue. addition, only relatively small percentage our users have transacted with Facebook Payments. the Facebook-integrated applications fail grow maintain their users and engagement, whether result the continued decline the usage Facebook personal computers otherwise, developers not continue introduce new applications that attract users and create engagement Facebook, Facebook-integrated applications outside social games not gain popularity and generate significant revenue for , our financial performance could adversely affected. Payment transactions may subject additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could costly and difficult comply with that could harm our business. Our users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure the Facebook website. addition, certain our users can use our Payments infrastructure, including Messenger, for other activities, such sending money other users and making donations certain charitable organizations. are subject variety laws and regulations the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, charitable fundraising, and import and export restrictions. Depending how our Payments product evolves, may also subject other laws and regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and lending. some jurisdictions, the application interpretation these laws and regulations not clear. increase flexibility how our use Payments may evolve and mitigate regulatory uncertainty, have received certain money transmitter licenses the United States and Electronic Money ( -Money) license that allows conduct certain regulated payment activities the participating member countries the European Economic Area, which will generally require demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws these areas. Our efforts comply with these laws and regulations could costly and result diversion management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. the event that are found violation any such legal regulatory requirements, may subject monetary fines other penalties such cease and desist order, may required make product changes, any which could have adverse effect our business and financial results. addition, may subject variety additional risks result Payments transactions, including: • increased costs and diversion management time and effort and other resources deal with bad transactions customer disputes; • potential fraudulent otherwise illegal activity users, developers, employees, third parties; • restrictions the investment consumer funds used transact Payments; and • additional disclosure and reporting requirements. have significant international operations and plan continue expanding our operations abroad where have more limited operating experience, and this may subject increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results. have significant international operations and plan continue the international expansion our business operations and the translation our products. currently make Facebook available more than different languages, and have offices data centers more than different countries. may enter new international markets where have limited experience marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are generally available globally through the web and mobile, but some all our products functionality may not available certain markets due legal and regulatory complexities. For example, Facebook and certain our other products are not generally available China. also outsource certain operational functions third-party vendors globally. fail deploy, manage, oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. addition, are subject variety risks inherent doing business internationally, including: • political, social, economic instability; • risks related legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable . companies with sales and operations foreign jurisdictions, including with respect privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade compliance, intellectual property, and terrestrial infrastructure matters; • potential damage our brand and reputation due compliance with local laws, including potential censorship requirements provide user information local authorities; • fluctuations currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls; • foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent from repatriating cash earned countries outside the United States otherwise limit our ability move cash freely, and impede our ability invest such cash efficiently; • higher levels credit risk and payment fraud; • enhanced difficulties integrating any foreign acquisitions; • burdens complying with variety foreign laws; • reduced protection for intellectual property rights some countries; • difficulties staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations; • compliance with the . Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the . Bribery Act, and similar laws other jurisdictions; and • compliance with statutory equity requirements and management tax consequences. are unable expand internationally and manage the complexity our global operations successfully, our financial results could adversely affected. face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks that, not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results. face number risks related design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect our Oculus products. For example, the Oculus products sell may have quality issues resulting from the design manufacture the products, from the software used the products. Sometimes, these issues may caused components purchase from other manufacturers suppliers. the quality our Oculus products does not meet our customers\' expectations such products are found defective, then our brand and financial results could adversely affected. rely third parties manufacture our Oculus products. may experience supply shortages other supply chain disruptions the future that could result shipping delays and negatively impact our operations. could negatively affected are not able engage third parties with the necessary capabilities capacity reasonable terms, those engage with fail meet their obligations (whether due financial difficulties other reasons), make adverse changes the pricing other material terms such arrangements with them. also require the suppliers and business partners our Oculus products comply with laws and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards labor, health and safety, the environment, and business ethics, but not control them their practices and standards. any them violates laws implements practices standards regarded unethical, corrupt, non-compliant, could experience supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, damage our reputation. addition, the SEC’ conflict minerals rule requires disclosure public companies information relating the origin, source and chain custody specified minerals, known conflict minerals, that are necessary the functionality production products manufactured contracted manufactured. may incur significant costs associated with complying with the rule, such costs related the determination the origin, source and chain custody the minerals used Oculus products, the adoption conflict minerals-related governance policies, processes and controls, and possible changes products sources supply result such activities. may face inventory risk with respect our Oculus products. may exposed inventory risks with respect our Oculus products result rapid changes product cycles and pricing, unsafe defective merchandise, changes consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes consumer tastes with respect Oculus products, and other factors. endeavor accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking understocking products Oculus may sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory components are ordered and the date sale. addition, when begin selling manufacturing new Oculus product, may difficult establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition certain types inventory components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not returnable. Any one these factors may adversely affect our operating results. may have exposure greater than anticipated tax liabilities. Our income tax obligations are based part our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner which operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property and the valuations our intercompany transactions. may also subject additional indirect non-income taxes. The tax laws applicable our business, including the laws the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws new ways effort raise additional tax revenue from companies such Facebook. The taxing authorities the jurisdictions which operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position, results operations, and cash flows. For example, , the IRS issued formal assessment relating transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries conjunction with the examination the tax year, and although disagree with the IRS\' position and are contesting this issue, the ultimate resolution uncertain and, resolved manner unfavorable , may adversely affect our financial results. are subject regular review and audit . federal and state, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions have taken and any adverse outcome such review audit could have negative effect our financial position, results operations, and cash flows. addition, the determination our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination uncertain. Our provision for income taxes also determined the manner which operate our business, and any changes such operations laws applicable such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Changes accounting for intercompany transactions may also affect our effective tax rate. For example, with the adoption Accounting Standards Update . - , effective January , , the income tax effects intercompany transfer will recognized the period which the transfer occurs, rather than amortized over time, which may increase the impact such transfers our effective tax rate particular period. Although believe that our provision for income taxes reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results the period periods for which such determination made. addition, our future income tax rates could adversely affected earnings being lower than anticipated jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes the valuation our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes tax laws, regulations, accounting principles. For example, have previously incurred losses certain international subsidiaries that resulted effective tax rate that significantly higher than the statutory tax rate the United States and this could continue happen the future.

Use Estimates Conformity with GAAP requires the use estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. These estimates form the basis for judgments make about the carrying values our assets and liabilities, which are not readily apparent from other sources. base our estimates and judgments historical information and various other assumptions that believe are reasonable under the circumstances. GAAP requires make estimates and judgments several areas, including, but not limited , those related revenue recognition, collectability accounts receivable, commitments and contingencies, fair value financial instruments, fair value acquired intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives intangible assets and property and equipment, leases, and income taxes. These estimates are based management\' knowledge about current events and expectations about actions may undertake the future. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. Revenue Recognition recognize revenue once all the following criteria have been met: • persuasive evidence arrangement exists; • delivery our obligations our customer has occurred; • the price fixed determinable; and • collectability the related receivable reasonably assured. Revenue for the years ended December , , , and consists the following ( millions): Year Ended December , Advertising $ , $ , $ , Payments and other fees Total revenue $ , $ , $ , Advertising Advertising revenue generated displaying products Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and third-party affiliated websites mobile applications. The arrangements are evidenced either online acceptance terms and conditions contracts that stipulate the types advertising delivered, the timing and the pricing. Marketers pay for products either directly through their relationships with advertising agencies, based the number impressions delivered the number actions, such clicks, taken our users. recognize revenue from the display impression-based ads the contracted period which the impressions are delivered. Impressions are considered delivered when displayed users. recognize revenue from the delivery action-based ads the period which user takes the action the marketer contracted for. For advertising revenue arrangements where are not the primary obligor, recognize revenue net basis. Payments and Other Fees Payments revenue comprised the net fee receive from developers using our Payments infrastructure. Other fees revenue, which was not material for all periods presented our financial statements, consists primarily revenue from the delivery virtual reality platform devices and various other sources. Revenue recognized net applicable sales and other taxes. Cost Revenue Our cost revenue consists primarily expenses associated with the delivery and distribution our products. These include expenses related the operation our data centers, such facility and server equipment depreciation, salaries, benefits, and share-based compensation for employees our operations teams, and energy and bandwidth costs. Cost revenue also includes costs associated with partner arrangements, including content acquisition costs, credit card and other transaction fees related processing customer transactions, cost virtual reality platform device inventory sold, and amortization intangible assets. Content acquisition costs license and pay produce content order increase engagement the platform. For licensed content, capitalize the fee per title and record corresponding liability the gross amount the liability when the license period begins, the cost the title known and the title accepted and available for viewing. The amounts capitalized are limited estimated net realizable value fair value per title basis. The portion available for viewing within one year recognized prepaid expenses and other current assets and the remaining portion other assets the consolidated balance sheets. For original programming, capitalize costs associated with the production, including development costs and direct costs, those amounts are recoverable. Capitalized original programming costs are included other assets the consolidated balance sheets. Capitalized costs are amortized cost revenue the consolidated statements income based historical and estimated viewing patterns. Capitalized content costs are reviewed when event change circumstances indicates change the expected usefulness the content that the fair value may less than amortized cost. such changes are identified, capitalized content assets will stated the lower unamortized cost, net realizable value fair value. addition, unamortized costs for assets that have been, are expected , abandoned are written off. Capitalized content acquisition costs have not been material date. Income Taxes record provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences the reported results operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future consequences temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases assets and liabilities, well for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected apply taxable income for the years which those tax assets and liabilities are expected realized settled. recognize the deferred income tax effects change tax rates the period the enactment. record valuation allowance reduce our deferred tax assets the net amount that believe more likely than not realized. consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels income, expectations and risks associated with estimates future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies assessing the need for valuation allowance. recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only believe that more likely than not that the tax position will sustained examination the taxing authorities based the technical merits the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based assessment whether our available documentation corroborating the nature our activities supporting the tax credits will sufficient. Although believe that have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), can provide assurance that the final tax outcome these matters will not materially different. make adjustments these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such the closing tax audit the refinement estimate. the extent that the final tax outcome these matters different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes the period which such determination made and could have material impact our financial position, results operations, and cash flows. December , , the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the Tax Act) was enacted into law and the new legislation contains several key tax provisions that affected , including one-time mandatory transition tax accumulated foreign earnings and reduction the corporate income tax rate % effective January , , among others. are required recognize the effect the tax law changes the period enactment, such determining the transition tax, -measuring our . deferred tax assets and liabilities well reassessing the net realizability our deferred tax assets and liabilities. December , the SEC staff issued Staff Accounting Bulletin . , Income Tax Accounting Implications the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (SAB ), which allows record provisional amounts during measurement period not extend beyond one year the enactment date. Since the Tax Act was passed late the fourth quarter , and ongoing guidance and accounting interpretation expected over the next months, consider the accounting the transition tax, deferred tax -measurements, and other items incomplete due the forthcoming guidance and our ongoing analysis final year-end data and tax positions. expect complete our analysis within the measurement period accordance with SAB . See Note these notes the consolidated financial statements for additional information. Advertising Expense Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included marketing and sales expenses the accompanying consolidated statements income. incurred advertising expenses $ million , $ million , and $ million for the years ended December , , , and , respectively. Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist cash deposit with banks and investments money market funds with maturities days less from the date purchase. hold investments marketable securities, consisting . government securities, . government agency securities, and corporate debt securities . classify our marketable securities available-for-sale investments our current assets because they represent investments cash available for current operations. Our available-for-sale investments are carried estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net taxes, included accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income stockholders\' equity. Unrealized losses are charged against interest and other income (expense), net when decline fair value determined other-than-temporary. have not recorded any such impairment charge the periods presented. determine realized gains losses sale marketable securities specific identification method, and record such gains losses interest and other income (expense), net. classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based upon the term the remaining restrictions. Fair Value Financial Instruments apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized disclosed fair value the financial statements recurring basis. define fair value the price that would received from selling asset paid transfer liability orderly transaction between market participants the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required recorded fair value, consider the principal most advantageous market which would transact and the market-based risk measurements assumptions that market participants would use pricing the asset liability, such risks inherent valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value estimated applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level input that available and significant the fair value measurement: Level -Quoted prices active markets for identical assets liabilities. Level -Observable inputs other than quoted prices active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical similar assets liabilities inactive markets, other inputs that are observable can corroborated observable market data for substantially the full term the assets liabilities. Level -Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\' estimate assumptions that market participants would use pricing the asset liability. Our valuation techniques used measure the fair value money market funds and marketable debt securities were derived from quoted market prices alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. Our valuation technique used measure the fair value our contingent consideration liability December , was derived from the fair value our common stock such date. settled this contingent consideration liability July . Accounts Receivable and Allowances Accounts receivable are recorded and carried the original invoiced amount less allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. make estimates for the allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment various factors, including historical experience, the age the accounts receivable balances, credit quality our customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability collect from customers. Property and Equipment Property and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under capital leases, are stated cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives the assets the remaining lease term, whichever shorter. The estimated useful lives property and equipment are described below: Property and Equipment Useful Life Network equipment Three years Buildings Three years Computer software, office equipment and other Two five years Leased equipment and leasehold improvements Lesser estimated useful life remaining lease term Land and assets held within construction progress are not depreciated. Construction progress related the construction development property and equipment that have not yet been placed service for their intended use. The cost maintenance and repairs expensed incurred. When assets are retired otherwise disposed , the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain loss such sale disposal reflected income from operations. Lease Obligations enter into lease arrangements for office space, land, facilities, data centers, and equipment under non-cancelable capital and operating leases. Certain the operating lease agreements contain rent holidays, rent escalation provisions, and purchase options. Rent holidays and rent escalation provisions are considered determining the straight-line rent expense recorded over the lease term. The lease term begins the date initial possession the leased property for purposes recognizing lease expense straight-line basis over the term the lease. not assume renewals our determination the lease term unless the renewals are deemed reasonably assured lease inception. record assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred third parties under build- -suit lease arrangements the extent that are involved the construction structural improvements bear construction risk prior commencement lease. Loss Contingencies are involved legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax government inquiries and investigations that arise the ordinary course business. Certain these matters include speculative claims for substantial indeterminate amounts damages. record liability when believe that both probable that loss has been incurred and the amount can reasonably estimated. determine that loss reasonably possible and the loss range loss can estimated, disclose the possible loss the notes the consolidated financial statements. review the developments our contingencies that could affect the amount the provisions that has been previously recorded, and the matters and related possible losses disclosed. make adjustments our provisions and changes our disclosures accordingly reflect the impact negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment required determine both the probability and the estimated amount. Business Combinations allocate the fair value purchase consideration the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based their estimated fair values. The excess the fair value purchase consideration over the fair values these identifiable assets and liabilities recorded goodwill. Such valuations require management make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect intangible assets. Significant estimates valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited , future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management’ estimates fair value are based upon assumptions believed reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which not exceed one year from the acquisition date, may record adjustments the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset goodwill. Upon the conclusion the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded earnings. Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets evaluate the recoverability property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events circumstances indicate that the carrying amount such assets may not recoverable. The evaluation performed the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent the cash flows other assets and liabilities. Recoverability these assets measured comparison the carrying amounts the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected generate. such review indicates that the carrying amount property and equipment and intangible assets not recoverable, the carrying amount such assets reduced fair value. have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented. review goodwill for impairment least annually more frequently events changes circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value our single reporting unit below its carrying value. December , , impairment goodwill has been identified. Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives the assets. routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets. reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance amortized depreciated over the revised estimated useful life. Deferred Revenue and Deposits Deferred revenue consists billings and payments from marketers advance revenue recognition. Deposits relate unused balances held behalf our users. Once this balance utilized user, approximately % this amount would then payable the developer and the balance would recognized revenue.
