PART Item ', 'item 1a. ': "RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results operations, cash flows, and the trading price our common stock. STRATEGIC AND COMPETITIVE RISKS face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead lower revenue operating margins. Competition the technology sector Our competitors range size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them more effective deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers entry many our businesses are low and many the areas which compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions new products and services. Our ability remain competitive depends our success making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal businesses and consumers. Competition among platform-based ecosystems important element our business model has been create platform-based ecosystems which many participants can build diverse solutions. well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale the marketplace necessary achieve and maintain attractive margins. face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms. • competing vertically-integrated model, which single firm controls the software and hardware elements product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, wearables, and other endpoint devices. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform, including applications and content sold through their integrated marketplaces. They may also able claim security and performance benefits from their vertically integrated offer. also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services. the extent shift portion our business vertically integrated model increase our cost revenue and reduce our operating margins. • derive substantial revenue from licenses Windows operating systems PCs. face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete multiple bases including price and the perceived utility the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning these devices perform functions that the past were performed personal computers. Even many users view these devices complementary personal computer, the prevalence these devices may make more difficult attract application developers our operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed low cost may decrease our operating system margins. Popular products services offered competing platforms could increase their competitive strength. addition, some our devices compete with products made our original equipment manufacturer (“OEM”) partners, which may affect their commitment our platform. • Competing platforms have content and application marketplaces with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility content and applications available platform are important device purchasing decisions. Users may incur costs move data and buy new content and applications when switching platforms. compete, must successfully enlist developers write applications for our platform and ensure that these applications have high quality, security, customer appeal, and value. Efforts compete with competitors’ content and application marketplaces may increase our cost revenue and lower our operating margins. Competitors’ rules governing their content and applications marketplaces may restrict our ability distribute products and services through them accordance with our technical and business model objectives. PART Item Business model competition Companies compete with based growing variety business models. • Even transition more our business infrastructure-, platform-, and software- - -service business model, the license-based proprietary software model generates substantial portion our software revenue. bear the costs converting original ideas into software products through investments research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many our competitors also develop and sell software businesses and consumers under this model. • Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development products and services these competitors provide users little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products. • Some companies compete with modifying and then distributing open source software little cost end users, and earning revenue advertising integrated products and services. These firms not bear the full costs research and development for the open source software. Some open source software mimics the features and functionality our products. The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and increased operating costs, such for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Our increasing focus cloud-based services presents execution and competitive risks. growing part our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum computing devices. Our strategic vision compete and grow building best- -class platforms and productivity services for intelligent cloud and intelligent edge infused with artificial intelligence (“ ”). the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services the cloud and sometimes the user’ choice which cloud-based services use. are devoting significant resources develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue evolve with this changing environment. embrace cultural and organizational changes drive accountability and eliminate obstacles innovation. Our intelligent cloud and intelligent edge worldview connected with the growth the Internet Things (“IoT”). Our success the IoT will depend the level adoption our offerings such Azure, Azure Stack, Azure IoT Edge, and Azure Sphere. may not establish market share sufficient achieve scale necessary meet our business objectives. Besides software development costs, are incurring costs build and maintain infrastructure support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins have previously achieved. Whether succeed cloud-based services depends our execution several areas, including: • Continuing bring market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share. • Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance our cloud-based services the growing array computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other devices, well sensors and other IoT endpoints. • Continuing enhance the attractiveness our cloud platforms third-party developers. • Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations our customers and maintain the security their data well help them meet their own compliance needs. • Making our suite cloud-based services platform-agnostic, available wide range devices and ecosystems, including those our competitors. uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users generate the revenue required succeed. are not effective executing organizational and technical changes increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, fail generate sufficient usage our new products and services, may not grow revenue line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income. PART Item RISKS RELATING THE EVOLUTION OUR BUSINESS make significant investments products and services that may not achieve expected returns. will continue make significant investments research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, Microsoft , Office, Bing, SQL Server, Windows Server, Azure, Office , Xbox, LinkedIn, and other products and services. also invest the development and acquisition variety hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, gaming devices, and HoloLens. Investments new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. customers not perceive our latest offerings providing significant new functionality other value, they may reduce their purchases new software and hardware products upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, all. New products and services may not profitable, and even they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not high the margins have experienced historically. may not get engagement certain features, like Edge and Bing, that drive post-sale monetization opportunities. Our data handling practices across our products and services will continue under scrutiny and perceptions mismanagement, driven regulatory activity negative public reaction our practices product experiences, could negatively impact product and feature adoption, product design, and product quality. Developing new technologies complex. can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays new releases significant problems creating new products services could adversely affect our revenue. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have adverse effect our business. expect continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances part our long-term business strategy. For example, March completed our acquisition ZeniMax Media Inc. for $ billion, and March completed our acquisition Nuance Communications, Inc. for $ billion. January announced definitive agreement acquire Activision Blizzard , Inc. for $ billion. These acquisitions and other transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks, including that they not advance our business strategy, that get unsatisfactory return our investment, that they raise new compliance-related obligations and challenges, that have difficulty integrating and retaining new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses, that announced transactions may not completed. arrangement fails adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests party, may result early termination renegotiation the arrangement. The success these transactions and arrangements will depend part our ability leverage them enhance our existing products and services develop compelling new ones, well acquired companies’ ability meet our policies and processes areas such data governance, privacy, and cybersecurity. may take longer than expected realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements such increased revenue enhanced efficiencies, the benefits may ultimately smaller than expected. These events could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements. our goodwill amortizable intangible assets become impaired, may required record significant charge earnings. acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause impairment goodwill intangibles. review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events changes circumstances indicate the carrying value may not recoverable. test goodwill for impairment least annually. Factors that may change circumstances, indicating that the carrying value our goodwill amortizable intangible assets may not recoverable, include decline our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates industry segments which participate. have the past recorded, and may the future required record, significant charge our consolidated financial statements during the period which any impairment our goodwill amortizable intangible assets determined, negatively affecting our results operations. PART Item CYBERSECURITY, DATA PRIVACY, AND PLATFORM ABUSE RISKS Cyberattacks and security vulnerabilities could lead reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, harm our reputation competitive position. Security our information technology Threats security can take variety forms. Individual and groups hackers and sophisticated organizations, including state-sponsored organizations nation-states, continuously undertake attacks that pose threats our customers and our . These actors may use wide variety methods, which may include developing and deploying malicious software exploiting vulnerabilities hardware, software, other infrastructure order attack our products and services gain access our networks and datacenters, using social engineering techniques induce our employees, users, partners, customers disclose passwords other sensitive information take other actions gain access our data our users’ customers’ data, acting coordinated manner launch distributed denial service other coordinated attacks. Nation-state and state-sponsored actors can deploy significant resources plan and carry out exploits. Nation-state attacks against our customers may intensify during periods intense diplomatic armed conflict, such the ongoing conflict Ukraine. Inadequate account security practices may also result unauthorized access confidential data. For example, system administrators may fail timely remove employee account access when longer appropriate. Employees third parties may intentionally compromise our our users’ security systems reveal confidential information. Malicious actors may employ the supply chain introduce malware through software updates compromised supplier accounts hardware. Cyberthreats are constantly evolving and becoming increasingly sophisticated and complex, increasing the difficulty detecting and successfully defending against them. may have current capability detect certain vulnerabilities, which may allow them persist the environment over long periods time. Cyberthreats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems and those our partners and customers. Breaches our facilities, network, data security could disrupt the security our systems and business applications, impair our ability provide services our customers and protect the privacy their data, result product development delays, compromise confidential technical business information harming our reputation competitive position, result theft misuse our intellectual property other assets, subject ransomware attacks, require allocate more resources improve technologies remediate the impacts attacks, otherwise adversely affect our business. The cyberattacks uncovered late known “Solorigate” “Nobelium” are example supply chain attack where malware was introduced software provider’ customers, including , through software updates. The attackers were later able create false credentials that appeared legitimate certain customers’ systems. may targets further attacks similar Solorigate Nobelium both supplier and consumer . addition, our internal environment continues evolve. Often, are early adopters new devices and technologies. embrace new ways sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes new threats emerge, emerging cybersecurity regulations jurisdictions worldwide. PART Item Security our products, services, devices, and customers’ data The security our products and services important our customers’ decisions purchase use our products services across cloud and -premises environments. Security threats are significant challenge companies like whose business providing technology products and services others. Threats our own infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely the security our infrastructure, including hardware and other elements provided third parties, ensure the reliability our services and the protection their data. Adversaries tend focus their efforts the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many ours, and expect that continue. addition, adversaries can attack our customers’ -premises cloud environments, sometimes exploiting previously unknown (“zero day”) vulnerabilities, such occurred early calendar year with several our Exchange Server -premises products. Vulnerabilities these any product can persist even after have issued security patches customers have not installed the most recent updates, the attackers exploited the vulnerabilities before patching install additional malware further compromise customers’ systems. Adversaries will continue attack customers using our cloud services customers embrace digital transformation. Adversaries that acquire user account information can use that information compromise our users’ accounts, including where accounts share the same attributes such passwords. Inadequate account security practices may also result unauthorized access, and user activity may result ransomware other malicious software impacting customer’ use our products services. are increasingly incorporating open source software into our products. There may vulnerabilities open source software that may make our products susceptible cyberattacks. Our customers operate complex systems with third-party hardware and software from multiple vendors that may include systems acquired over many years. They expect our products and services support all these systems and products, including those that longer incorporate the strongest current security advances standards. result, may not able discontinue support our services for product, service, standard, feature solely because more secure alternative available. Failure utilize the most current security advances and standards can increase our customers’ vulnerability attack. Further, customers widely varied size and technical sophistication use our technology, and consequently may have limited capabilities and resources help them adopt and implement state the art cybersecurity practices and technologies. addition, must account for this wide variation technical sophistication when defining default settings for our products and services, including security default settings, these settings may limit otherwise impact other aspects operations and some customers may have limited capability review and reset these defaults. Cyberattacks such Solorigate Nobelium may adversely impact our customers even our production services are not directly compromised. are committed notifying our customers whose systems have been impacted become aware and have available information and actions for customers help protect themselves. are also committed providing guidance and support detection, tracking, and remediation. may not able detect the existence extent these attacks for all our customers have information how detect track attack, especially where attack involves -premises software such Exchange Server where may have limited visibility into our customers’ computing environments. Development and deployment defensive measures defend against security threats our internal systems, our cloud-based services, and our customers’ systems, must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment software updates address security vulnerabilities our own products well those provided others, develop mitigation technologies that help secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity our network, products, and services, and provide security tools such firewalls, anti-virus software, and advanced security and information about the need deploy security measures and the impact doing . Customers certain industries such financial services, health care, and government may have enhanced specialized requirements which must engineer our products and services. PART Item The cost measures protect products and customer-facing services could reduce our operating margins. fail these things well, actual perceived security vulnerabilities our products and services, data corruption issues, reduced performance could harm our reputation and lead customers reduce delay future purchases products subscriptions services, use competing products services. Customers may also spend more protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption additional products services. Customers, and third parties granted access their systems, may fail update their systems, continue run software operating systems longer support, may fail timely install enable security patches, may otherwise fail adopt adequate security practices. Any these could adversely affect our reputation and revenue. Actual perceived vulnerabilities may lead claims against . Our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate limit our exposure liability, but there assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. times, achieve commercial objectives, may enter into agreements with larger liability exposure customers. Our products operate conjunction with and are dependent products and components across broad ecosystem third parties. there security vulnerability one these components, and there security exploit targeting , could face increased costs, liability claims, reduced revenue, harm our reputation competitive position. Disclosure and misuse personal data could result liability and harm our reputation. continue grow the number, breadth, and scale our cloud-based offerings, store and process increasingly large amounts personal data our customers and users. The continued occurrence high-profile data breaches provides evidence external environment increasingly hostile information security. Despite our efforts improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, possible our security controls over personal data, our training employees and third parties data security, and other practices follow may not prevent the improper disclosure misuse customer user data our vendors store and manage. addition, third parties who have limited access our customer user data may use this data unauthorized ways. Improper disclosure misuse could harm our reputation, lead legal exposure customers users, subject liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting increased costs loss revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers and users store and process personal data -premises , increasingly, cloud-based environment host. Government authorities can sometimes require produce customer user data response valid legal orders. the . and elsewhere, advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations government authority compel disclosure. Despite our efforts protect customer and user data, perceptions that the collection, use, and retention personal information not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales our products services and could limit adoption our cloud-based solutions consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures may take address customer user concerns, constraints our flexibility determine where and how operate datacenters response customer user expectations governmental rules actions, may cause higher operating expenses hinder growth our products and services. may not able protect information our products and services from use others .

When discovered users, such content may negatively affect our reputation, our brands, and user engagement. Regulations and other initiatives make platforms responsible for preventing eliminating harmful content online have been enacted, and expect this continue. may subject enhanced regulatory oversight, civil criminal liability, reputational damage fail comply with content moderation regulations, adversely affecting our business and consolidated financial statements. The development the IoT presents security, privacy, and execution risks. support the growth the intelligent cloud and the intelligent edge, are developing products, services, and technologies power the IoT, network distributed and interconnected devices employing sensors, data, and computing capabilities including . The IoT’ great potential also carries substantial risks. IoT products and services may contain defects design, manufacture, operation that make them insecure ineffective for their intended purposes. IoT solution has multiple layers hardware, sensors, processors, software, and firmware, several which may not develop control. Each layer, including the weakest layer, can impact the security the whole system. Many IoT devices have limited interfaces and ability updated patched. IoT solutions may collect large amounts data, and our handling IoT data may not satisfy customers regulatory requirements. IoT scenarios may increasingly affect personal health and safety. IoT solutions that include our technologies not work intended, violate the law, harm individuals businesses, may subject legal claims enforcement actions. These risks, realized, may increase our costs, damage our reputation brands, negatively impact our revenues margins. Issues the development and use may result reputational harm liability . are building into many our offerings, including our productivity services, and are also making first- and third-party available for our customers use solutions that they build. expect these elements our business grow. envision future which operating our devices, applications, and the cloud helps our customers more productive their work and personal lives. with many innovations, presents risks and challenges that could affect its adoption, and therefore our business. algorithms may flawed. Datasets may insufficient contain biased information. Ineffective inadequate development deployment practices Microsoft others could result incidents that impair the acceptance solutions cause harm individuals society. These deficiencies and other failures systems could subject competitive harm, regulatory action, legal liability, including under new proposed legislation regulating jurisdictions such the European Union (“ ”), and brand reputational harm. Some scenarios present ethical issues. enable offer solutions that are controversial because their impact human rights, privacy, employment, other social, economic, political issues, may experience brand reputational harm. OPERATIONAL RISKS may have excessive outages, data losses, and disruptions our online services fail maintain adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth services, and the complexity our products and services demand more computing power. spend substantial amounts build, purchase, lease datacenters and equipment and upgrade our technology and network infrastructure handle more traffic our websites and our datacenters. Our datacenters depend predictable energy and networking supplies, the cost availability which could adversely affected variety factors, including the transition clean energy economy and geopolitical disruptions. These demands continue increase introduce new products and services and support the growth existing services such Bing, Azure, Microsoft Account services, Microsoft , Microsoft Teams, Dynamics , OneDrive, SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox, and Outlook com. are rapidly growing our business providing platform and back-end hosting for services provided third parties their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure expensive and complex, and requires development principles for datacenter builds geographies with higher safety risks. requires that maintain Internet connectivity infrastructure and storage and compute capacity that robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue evolve. Inefficiencies operational failures, including temporary permanent loss customer data, insufficient Internet connectivity, inadequate storage and compute capacity, could diminish the quality our products, services, and user experience resulting contractual liability, claims customers and other third parties, regulatory actions, damage our reputation, and loss current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each which may adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. PART Item may experience quality supply problems. Our hardware products such Xbox consoles, Surface devices, and other devices design and market are highly complex and can have defects design, manufacture, associated software. could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm result recalls, safety alerts, product liability claims fail prevent, detect, address such issues through design, testing, warranty repairs. Our software products and services also may experience quality reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Our customers increasingly rely for critical business functions and multiple workloads. Many our products and services are interdependent with one another. Each these circumstances potentially magnifies the impact quality reliability issues. Any defects not detect and fix pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage our reputation, repair remediation costs, delays the release new products versions, legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate limit our exposure liability, there assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. There are limited suppliers for certain device and datacenter components. Our competitors use some the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available . components are delayed become unavailable, whether because supplier capacity constraint, industry shortages, legal regulatory changes that restrict supply sources, other reasons, may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting reduced sales inadequate datacenter capacity. Component shortages, excess obsolete inventory, price reductions resulting inventory adjustments may increase our cost revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, datacenter servers, and other hardware are assembled Asia and other geographies that may subject disruptions the supply chain, resulting shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND LITIGATION RISKS Government litigation and regulatory activity relating competition rules may limit how design and market our products. leading global software and device maker, government agencies closely scrutinize under . and foreign competition laws. Governments are actively enforcing competition laws and regulations, and this includes scrutiny potentially large markets such the , the ., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors consumers assert claims anti-competitive conduct. . federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue scrutinize our business. The European Commission (“the Commission”) closely scrutinizes the design high-volume Microsoft products and the terms which make certain technologies used these products, such file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available other companies. Flagship product releases such Windows can receive significant scrutiny under competition laws. For example, , the Commission ordered create new versions our Windows operating system that not include certain multimedia technologies and provide our competitors with specifications for how implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols their own products. , the Commission accepted set commitments offered address the Commission’ concerns relating competition web browsing software, including undertaking address Commission concerns relating interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired . The remaining obligations may limit our ability innovate Windows other products the future, diminish the developer appeal the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability licenses related protocols and file formats may enable competitors develop software products that better mimic the functionality our products, which could hamper sales our products. Our portfolio first-party devices continues grow; the same time our OEM partners offer large variety devices for our platforms. result, increasingly both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating risk that fail compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly China and other countries Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure royalties for our intellectual property. PART Item Government regulatory actions and court decisions such these may result fines hinder our ability provide the benefits our software consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness our products and the revenue that come from them. New competition law actions could initiated, potentially using previous actions precedent. The outcome such actions, steps taken avoid them, could adversely affect variety ways, including: • may have choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies avoid fines designing and developing alternative versions those products comply with government rulings, which may entail delay product release and removing functionality that customers want which developers rely. • may required make available licenses our proprietary technologies terms that not reflect their fair market value not protect our associated intellectual property. • are subject variety ongoing commitments because court administrative orders, consent decrees, other voluntary actions have taken. fail comply with these commitments, may incur litigation costs and subject substantial fines other remedial actions. • Our ability realize anticipated Windows post-sale monetization opportunities may limited. • Regulatory scrutiny may inhibit our ability consummate acquisitions impose conditions that reduce the ultimate value such transactions. Our global operations subject potential consequences under anti-corruption, trade, and other laws and regulations. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (“FCPA”) and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (“Anti-Corruption Laws”) prohibit corrupt payments our employees, vendors, agents, and the accounting provisions the FCPA require maintain accurate books and records and adequate internal controls. From time time, receive inquiries from authorities the . and elsewhere which may based reports from employees and others about our business activities outside the . and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. Periodically, receive such reports directly and investigate them, and also cooperate with investigations . and foreign law enforcement authorities. example increasing international regulatory complexity the Whistleblower Directive, initiated , which may present compliance challenges the extent implemented different forms member states. Most countries which operate also have competition laws that prohibit competitors from colluding otherwise attempting reduce competition between themselves. While devote substantial resources our . and international compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed reduce the risk corrupt payments and collusive activity, our employees, vendors, agents may violate our policies. Our failure comply with Anti-Corruption Laws competition laws could result significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against , our officers, our employees, prohibitions the conduct our business, and damage our reputation. Increasing trade laws, policies, sanctions, and other regulatory requirements also affect our operations and outside the . relating trade and investment. Economic sanctions the ., the , and other countries prohibit most business with restricted entities countries such Crimea, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and Syria. . export controls restrict Microsoft from offering many its products and services , making investments , certain entities specified countries. . import controls restrict from integrating certain information and communication technologies into our supply chain and allow for government review transactions involving information and communications technology from countries determined foreign adversaries. Periods intense diplomatic armed conflict, such the ongoing conflict Ukraine, may result ( ) new and rapidly evolving sanctions and trade restrictions, which may impair trade with sanctioned individuals and countries, and ( ) negative impacts regional trade ecosystems among our customers, partners, and . Non-compliance with sanctions well general ecosystem disruptions could result reputational harm, operational delays, monetary fines, loss revenues, increased costs, loss export privileges, criminal sanctions. PART Item Other regulatory areas that may apply our products and online services offerings include requirements related user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, advertising, and online content. For example, some regulators are taking the position that our offerings such Microsoft Teams and Skype are covered existing laws regulating telecommunications services, and some new laws , including Member State laws under the European Electronic Communications Code, are defining more our services regulated telecommunications services. This trend may continue and will result these offerings being subjected additional data protection, security, and law enforcement surveillance obligations. Regulators may assert that our collection, use, and management customer data and other information inconsistent with their laws and regulations , including laws that apply the tracking users via technology such cookies . Legislative regulatory action relating cybersecurity requirements may increase the costs develop, implement, secure our products and services. Legislative and regulatory action emerging the area and content moderation, which could increase costs restrict opportunity. Applying these laws and regulations our business often unclear, subject change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments’ approach their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing evolve. Compliance with these types regulation may involve significant costs require changes products business practices that result reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result the imposition penalties orders stop the alleged noncompliant activity. strive empower all people and organizations achieve more, and accessibility our products important aspect this goal. There increasing pressure from advocacy groups, regulators, competitors, customers, and other stakeholders make technology more accessible. our products not meet customer expectations global accessibility requirements, could lose sales opportunities face regulatory legal actions. Laws and regulations relating the handling personal data may impede the adoption our services result increased costs, legal claims, fines against , reputational damage. The growth our Internet- and cloud-based services internationally relies increasingly the movement data across national boundaries. Legal requirements relating the collection, storage, handling, and transfer personal data continue evolve. For example, July the Court Justice the invalidated framework called Privacy Shield for companies transfer data from member states the United States. This ruling continues generate uncertainty about the legal requirements for data transfers from the under other legal mechanisms and has resulted some data protection authorities blocking the use .-based services that involve the transfer data the . The . and the March agreed principle replacement framework for the Privacy Shield, called the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework. failure the . and finalize the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework could compound that uncertainty and result additional blockages data transfers. Potential new rules and restrictions the flow data across borders could increase the cost and complexity delivering our products and services some markets. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) applies all our activities conducted from establishment the related products and services offered the , imposes range compliance obligations regarding the handling personal data. More recently, the has been developing new requirements related the use data, including the Digital Markets Act, the Digital Services Act, and the Data Act, that will add additional rules and restriction the use data our products and services. Engineering efforts build and maintain capabilities facilitate compliance with these laws involve substantial expense and the diversion engineering resources from other projects. might experience reduced demand for our offerings are unable engineer products that meet our legal duties help our customers meet their obligations under the GDPR and other data regulations, our implementation comply with the GDPR makes our offerings less attractive. Compliance with these obligations depends part how particular regulators interpret and apply them. fail comply, regulators assert have failed comply (including response complaints made customers), may lead regulatory enforcement actions, which can result monetary penalties ( % worldwide revenue the case GDPR), private lawsuits, reputational damage, blockage international data transfers, and loss customers. The highest fines assessed under GDPR have recently been increasing, especially against large technology companies. Jurisdictions around the world, such China, India, and states the . have adopted, are considering adopting expanding, laws and regulations imposing obligations regarding the handling transfer personal data. PART Item The Company’ investment gaining insights from data becoming central the value the services deliver customers, our operational efficiency and key opportunities monetization, customer perceptions quality, and operational efficiency. Our ability use data this way may constrained regulatory developments that impede realizing the expected return from this investment. Ongoing legal analyses, reviews, and inquiries regulators Microsoft practices, relevant practices other organizations, may result burdensome inconsistent requirements, including data sovereignty and localization requirements, affecting the location, movement, collection, and use our customer and internal employee data well the management that data. Compliance with applicable laws and regulations regarding personal data may require changes services, business practices, internal systems that result increased costs, lower revenue, reduced efficiency, greater difficulty competing with foreign-based firms. Compliance with data regulations might limit our ability innovate offer certain features and functionality some jurisdictions where operate. Failure comply with existing new rules may result significant penalties orders stop the alleged noncompliant activity, well negative publicity and diversion management time and effort. have claims and lawsuits against that may result adverse outcomes. are subject variety claims and lawsuits. These claims may arise from wide variety business practices and initiatives, including major new product releases such Windows, significant business transactions, warranty product claims, and employment practices. Adverse outcomes some all these claims may result significant monetary damages injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are subject inherent uncertainties and management’ view these matters may change the future. material adverse impact our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period which the effect unfavorable outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. Our business with government customers may present additional uncertainties. derive substantial revenue from government contracts. Government contracts generally can present risks and challenges not present private commercial agreements. For instance, may subject government audits and investigations relating these contracts, could suspended debarred governmental contractor, could incur civil and criminal fines and penalties, and under certain circumstances contracts may rescinded. Some agreements may allow government terminate without cause and provide for higher liability limits for certain losses. Some contracts may subject periodic funding approval, reductions, delays which could adversely impact public-sector demand for our products and services. These events could negatively impact our results operations, financial condition, and reputation. may have additional tax liabilities. are subject income taxes the . and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment required determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. the course our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination uncertain. For example, compliance with the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) and possible future legislative changes may require the collection information not regularly produced within the Company, the use estimates our consolidated financial statements, and the exercise significant judgment accounting for its provisions. regulations and guidance evolve with respect the TCJA possible future legislative changes, and gather more information and perform more analysis, our results may differ from previous estimates and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements. regularly are under audit tax authorities different jurisdictions. Although believe that our provision for income taxes and our tax estimates are reasonable, tax authorities may disagree with certain positions have taken. addition, economic and political pressures increase tax revenue various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. are currently under Internal Revenue Service audit for prior tax years, with the primary unresolved issues relating transfer pricing. The final resolution those audits, and other audits litigation, may differ from the amounts recorded our consolidated financial statements and may materially affect our consolidated financial statements the period periods which that determination made. earn significant amount our operating income outside the . change the mix earnings and losses countries with differing statutory tax rates, changes our business structure, the expiration disputes about certain tax agreements particular country may result higher effective tax rates for the Company. addition, changes . federal and state international tax laws applicable corporate multinationals, other fundamental law changes currently being considered many countries, including the ., and changes taxing jurisdictions’ administrative interpretations, decisions, policies, and positions may materially adversely impact our consolidated financial statements. PART Item INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS may not able protect our source code from copying there unauthorized disclosure. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, critical our business. Although license portions our application and operating system source code several licensees, take significant measures protect the secrecy large portions our source code. our source code leaks, might lose future trade secret protection for that code. may then become easier for third parties compete with our products copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure source code also could increase the security risks described elsewhere these risk factors. Legal changes, our evolving business model, piracy, and other factors may decrease the value our intellectual property. Protecting our intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use our software and other intellectual property global basis difficult. While piracy adversely affects . revenue, the impact revenue from outside the . more significant, particularly countries which the legal system provides less protection for intellectual property rights. Our revenue these markets may grow more slowly than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence harmonized patent laws makes more difficult ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, educate users about the benefits licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and educate lawmakers about the advantages business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue. expend significant resources patent the intellectual property create with the expectation that will generate revenues incorporating that intellectual property our products services , some instances, licensing cross-licensing our patents others return for royalty and increased freedom operate. Changes the law may continue weaken our ability prevent the use patented technology collect revenue for licensing our patents. These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make more difficult obtain injunctions, and the increasing use legal process challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees our patents may fail satisfy their obligations pay royalties may contest the scope and extent their obligations. The royalties can obtain monetize our intellectual property may decline because the evolution technology, price changes products using licensed patents, greater value from cross-licensing, the difficulty discovering infringements. Finally, our increasing engagement with open source software will also cause license our intellectual property rights broadly certain situations and may negatively impact revenue. Third parties may claim infringe their intellectual property rights. From time time, others claim infringe their intellectual property rights. The number these claims may grow because constant technological change the markets which compete, the extensive patent coverage existing technologies, the rapid rate issuance new patents, and our offering first-party devices, such Surface. resolve these claims, may enter into royalty and licensing agreements terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling redesign affected products services, pay damages satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins decline. Besides money damages, some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products services that have infringing technologies. some countries, such Germany, injunction can issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity the underlying patents. have paid significant amounts settle claims related the use technology and intellectual property rights and procure intellectual property rights part our strategy manage this risk, and may continue . GENERAL RISKS our reputation our brands are damaged, our business and operating results may harmed . Our reputation and brands are globally recognized and are important our business. Our reputation and brands affect our ability attract and retain consumer, business, and public-sector customers. There are numerous ways our reputation brands could damaged.

Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict, such the ongoing conflict Ukraine, pose risk general economic disruption affected countries, which may increase our operating costs and negatively impact our ability sell and collect from customers affected markets. These conditions also may add uncertainty the timing and budget for technology investment decisions our customers and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers. Geopolitical change may result changing regulatory systems and requirements and market interventions that could impact our operating strategies, access national, regional, and global markets, hiring, and profitability. Geopolitical instability may lead sanctions and impact our ability business some markets with some public-sector customers. Any these changes may negatively impact our revenues. The occurrence regional epidemics global pandemic such COVID- may adversely affect our operations, financial condition, and results operations. The COVID- pandemic has had widespread, rapidly evolving, and unpredictable impacts global society, economies, financial markets, and business practices. The extent which global pandemics impact our business going forward will depend factors such the duration and scope the pandemic; governmental, business, and individuals' actions response the pandemic; and the impact economic activity including the possibility recession financial market instability. PART Item Measures contain global pandemic may intensify other risks described these Risk Factors. Any these measures may adversely impact our ability : • Maintain our operations infrastructure, including the reliability and adequate capacity cloud services. • Satisfy our contractual and regulatory compliance obligations adapt changing usage patterns, such through datacenter load balancing. • Ensure high-quality and consistent supply chain and manufacturing operations for our hardware devices and datacenter operations. • Effectively manage our international operations through changes trade practices and policies. • Hire and deploy people where most need them. • Sustain the effectiveness and productivity our operations including our sales, marketing, engineering, and distribution functions. may incur increased costs effectively manage these aspects our business. are unsuccessful may adversely impact our revenues, cash flows, market share growth, and reputation. The long-term effects climate change the global economy and the industry particular are unclear. Environmental regulations changes the supply, demand available sources energy other resources may affect the availability cost goods and services, including natural resources, necessary run our business. Changes climate where operate may increase the costs powering and cooling computer hardware use develop software and provide cloud-based services. Our global business exposes operational and economic risks. Our customers are located throughout the world and significant part our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature our business creates operational, economic, and geopolitical risks. Our results operations may affected global, regional, and local economic developments, monetary policy, inflation, and recession, well political and military disputes. addition, our international growth strategy includes certain markets, the developing nature which presents several risks, including deterioration social, political, labor, economic conditions country region, and difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations. Emerging nationalist and protectionist trends and concerns about human rights and political expression specific countries may significantly alter the trade and commercial environments. Changes trade policy agreements result populism, protectionism, economic nationalism may result higher tariffs, local sourcing initiatives, and non-local sourcing restrictions, export controls, investment restrictions, other developments that make more difficult sell our products foreign countries.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE Refer Note – Accounting Policies the Notes Financial Statements (Part , Item this Form - ) for further discussion. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared accordance with GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Critical accounting estimates are those estimates that involve significant level estimation uncertainty and could have material impact our financial condition results operations. have critical accounting estimates the areas revenue recognition, impairment investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, legal and other contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. Revenue Recognition Our contracts with customers often include promises transfer multiple products and services customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When cloud-based service includes both -premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment required determine whether the software license considered distinct and accounted for separately, not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office , depend significant level integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together one performance obligation. Revenue from Office recognized ratably over the period which the cloud services are provided. Judgment required determine the stand-alone selling price (“SSP") for each distinct performance obligation. use single amount estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including -premises licenses sold with software updates provided additional charge. use range amounts estimate SSP when sell each the products and services separately and need determine whether there discount allocated based the relative SSP the various products and services. instances where SSP not directly observable, such when not sell the product service separately, determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due the stratification those products and services customers and circumstances. these instances, may use information such the size the customer and geographic region determining the SSP. Due the various benefits from and the nature our program, judgment required assess the pattern delivery, including the exercise pattern certain benefits across our portfolio customers. PART Item Our products are generally sold with right return, may provide other credits incentives, and certain instances estimate customer usage our products and services, which are accounted for variable consideration when determining the amount revenue recognize. Returns and credits are estimated contract inception and updated the end each reporting period additional information becomes available. Changes our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Impairment Investment Securities review debt investments quarterly for credit losses and impairment. the cost investment exceeds its fair value, evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality debt instrument issuers, and the extent which the fair value less than cost. This determination requires significant judgment. making this judgment, employ systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence evaluating potential impairment our investments. addition, consider specific adverse conditions related the financial health , and business outlook for, the investee. have plans sell the security more likely than not that will required sell the security before recovery, then decline fair value below cost recorded impairment charge other income (expense), net and new cost basis the investment established. market, industry, and investee conditions deteriorate, may incur future impairments. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are written down fair value qualitative assessment indicates that the investment impaired and the fair value the investment less than carrying value. perform qualitative assessment periodic basis. are required estimate the fair value the investment determine the amount the impairment loss. Once investment determined impaired, impairment charge recorded other income (expense), net. Goodwill allocate goodwill reporting units based the reporting unit expected benefit from the business combination. evaluate our reporting units annual basis and, necessary, reassign goodwill using relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill tested for impairment the reporting unit level (operating segment one level below operating segment) annual basis (May for ) and between annual tests event occurs circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value reporting unit below its carrying value. These events circumstances could include significant change the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale disposition significant portion reporting unit. Application the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification reporting units, assignment assets and liabilities reporting units, assignment goodwill reporting units, and determination the fair value each reporting unit. The fair value each reporting unit estimated primarily through the use discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation future cash flows, which dependent internal forecasts, estimation the long-term rate growth for our business, estimation the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination our weighted average cost capital. The estimates used calculate the fair value reporting unit change from year year based operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally researching and developing computer software product are charged expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility established, software costs are capitalized until the product available for general release customers. Judgment required determining when technological feasibility product established. have determined that technological feasibility for our software products reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released production. The amortization these costs included cost revenue over the estimated life the products. PART Item Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes legal proceedings and claims brought against are subject significant uncertainty. estimated loss from loss contingency such legal proceeding claim accrued charge income probable that asset has been impaired liability has been incurred and the amount the loss can reasonably estimated. determining whether loss should accrued evaluate, among other factors, the degree probability unfavorable outcome and the ability make reasonable estimate the amount loss. Changes these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes The objectives accounting for income taxes are recognize the amount taxes payable refundable for the current year, and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences events that have been recognized entity’ financial statements tax returns. recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax position only more likely than not that the tax position will sustained examination the taxing authorities, based the technical merits the position.

Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related the purchase and production inventories. Net realizable value the estimated selling price less estimated costs completion, disposal, and transportation. regularly review inventory quantities hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility our inventory. These reviews include analysis demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. our review indicates reduction utility below carrying value, reduce our inventory new cost basis through charge cost revenue.

PART Item NOTES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE — ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting Principles Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared accordance with accounting principles generally accepted the United States America (“GAAP”). have recast certain prior period amounts conform the current period presentation. The recast these prior period amounts had impact our consolidated balance sheets, consolidated income statements, consolidated cash flows statements. Principles Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples estimates and assumptions include: for revenue recognition, determining the nature and timing satisfaction performance obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (“SSP”) performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value and potential impairment goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value , and demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological feasibility achieved for our products; the potential outcome uncertain tax positions that have been recognized our consolidated financial statements tax returns; and determining the timing and amount impairments for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’ estimates and assumptions due risks and uncertainties. July , completed assessment the useful lives our server and network equipment. Due investments software that increased efficiencies how operate our server and network equipment, well advances technology, determined should increase the estimated useful lives both server and network equipment from four years six years . This change accounting estimate will effective beginning fiscal year . had previously increased the estimated useful lives both server and network equipment July . Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded foreign currencies are translated the exchange rate the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated average rates exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded other comprehensive income. Revenue Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue Product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity applications, server applications, business solution applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, video games, and hardware such PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories. Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content such Office , Azure, Dynamics , and Xbox; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and LinkedIn. PART Item Revenue Recognition Revenue recognized upon transfer control promised products services customers amount that reflects the consideration expect receive exchange for those products services. enter into contracts that can include various combinations products and services, which are generally capable being distinct and accounted for separate performance obligations. Revenue recognized net allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers, which are subsequently remitted governmental authorities. Nature Products and Services Licenses for -premises software provide the customer with right use the software exists when made available the customer. Customers may purchase perpetual licenses subscribe licenses, which provide customers with the same functionality and differ mainly the duration over which the customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct -premises licenses recognized upfront the point time when the software made available the customer. cases where allocate revenue software updates, primarily because the updates are provided additional charge, revenue recognized the updates are provided, which generally ratably over the estimated life the related device license. Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include -premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (“ ”). conveys rights new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides support, tools, and training help customers deploy and use products more efficiently. -premises licenses are considered distinct performance obligations when sold with . Revenue allocated generally recognized ratably over the contract period customers simultaneously consume and receive benefits, given that comprises distinct performance obligations that are satisfied over time. Cloud services, which allow customers use hosted software over the contract period without taking possession the software, are provided either subscription consumption basis. Revenue related cloud services provided subscription basis recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue related cloud services provided consumption basis, such the amount storage used period, recognized based the customer utilization such resources. When cloud services require significant level integration and interdependency with software and the individual components are not considered distinct, all revenue recognized over the period which the cloud services are provided. Revenue from search advertising recognized when the advertisement appears the search results when the action necessary earn the revenue has been completed. Revenue from consulting services recognized services are provided. Our hardware generally highly dependent , and interrelated with, the underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for single performance obligation and revenue recognized the point time when ownership transferred resellers directly end customers through retail stores and online marketplaces. Refer Note – Segment Information and Geographic Data for further information, including revenue significant product and service offering. Significant Judgments Our contracts with customers often include promises transfer multiple products and services customer. Determining whether products and services are considered distinct performance obligations that should accounted for separately versus together may require significant judgment. When cloud-based service includes both -premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment required determine whether the software license considered distinct and accounted for separately, not distinct and accounted for together with the cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office , depend significant level integration, interdependency, and interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are accounted for together one performance obligation. Revenue from Office recognized ratably over the period which the cloud services are provided. PART Item Judgment required determine the SSP for each distinct performance obligation. use single amount estimate SSP for items that are not sold separately, including -premises licenses sold with software updates provided additional charge. use range amounts estimate SSP when sell each the products and services separately and need determine whether there discount allocated based the relative SSP the various products and services. instances where SSP not directly observable, such when not sell the product service separately, determine the SSP using information that may include market conditions and other observable inputs. typically have more than one SSP for individual products and services due the stratification those products and services customers and circumstances. these instances, may use information such the size the customer and geographic region determining the SSP. Due the various benefits from and the nature our program, judgment required assess the pattern delivery, including the exercise pattern certain benefits across our portfolio customers. Our products are generally sold with right return, may provide other credits incentives, and certain instances estimate customer usage our products and services, which are accounted for variable consideration when determining the amount revenue recognize. Returns and credits are estimated contract inception and updated the end each reporting period additional information becomes available. Changes our estimated variable consideration were not material for the periods presented. Contract Balances and Other Receivables Timing revenue recognition may differ from the timing invoicing customers. record receivable when revenue recognized prior invoicing, unearned revenue when revenue recognized subsequent invoicing. For multi-year agreements, generally invoice customers annually the beginning each annual coverage period. record receivable related revenue recognized for multi-year -premises licenses have unconditional right invoice and receive payment the future related those licenses. Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related volume licensing programs, which may include and cloud services. Unearned revenue generally invoiced annually the beginning each contract period for multi-year agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue also includes payments for consulting services performed the future, LinkedIn subscriptions, Office subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for which have been paid advance and earn the revenue when transfer control the product service. Refer Note – Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned revenue segment and changes unearned revenue during the period. Payment terms and conditions vary contract type, although terms generally include requirement payment within days. instances where the timing revenue recognition differs from the timing invoicing, have determined our contracts generally not include significant financing component. The primary purpose our invoicing terms provide customers with simplified and predictable ways purchasing our products and services, not receive financing from our customers provide customers with financing. Examples include invoicing the beginning subscription term with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year -premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront. June , and , other receivables due from suppliers were $ billion and $ million, respectively, and are included accounts receivable, net our consolidated balance sheets. June , and , long-term accounts receivable, net allowance for doubtful accounts, was $ billion and $ billion, respectively, and included other long-term assets our consolidated balance sheets. The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate probable losses inherent the accounts receivable balance. determine the allowance based known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. PART Item Activity the allowance for doubtful accounts was follows: ( millions) Year Ended June , Balance, beginning period $ $ $ Charged costs and other Write-offs ( ) ( ) ( ) Balance, end period $ $ $ Allowance for doubtful accounts included our consolidated balance sheets: ( millions) June , Accounts receivable, net allowance for doubtful accounts $ $ $ Other long-term assets Total $ $ $ record financing receivables when offer certain our customers the option acquire our software products and services offerings through financing program limited number countries. June , and , our financing receivables, net were $ billion and $ billion, respectively, for short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included other current assets and other long-term assets our consolidated balance sheets. record allowance cover expected losses based troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Assets Recognized from Costs Obtain Contract with Customer recognize asset for the incremental costs obtaining contract with customer expect the benefit those costs longer than one year. have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements capitalized. Total capitalized costs obtain contract were immaterial during the periods presented and are included other current and long-term assets our consolidated balance sheets. apply practical expedient expense costs incurred for costs obtain contract with customer when the amortization period would have been one year less. These costs include our internal sales force compensation program and certain partner sales incentive programs have determined annual compensation commensurate with annual sales activities. Cost Revenue Cost revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred include software PCs sold original equipment manufacturers (“OEM”), drive traffic our websites, and acquire online advertising space; costs incurred support and maintain online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery consulting services; and the amortization capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives the products. Product Warranty provide for the estimated costs fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties the time the related revenue recognized. For hardware warranties, estimate the costs based historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge specific product failures ( any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country which business, but generally include parts and labor over period generally ranging from days three years. For software warranties, estimate the costs provide bug fixes, such security patches, over the estimated life the software. regularly reevaluate our estimates assess the adequacy the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts necessary. PART Item Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred translate software for international markets, and the amortization purchased software code and services content. Such costs related software development are included research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility reached, which for our software products, generally shortly before the products are released production. Once technological feasibility reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized cost revenue over the estimated lives the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed incurred. Advertising expense was $ billion, $ billion, and $ billion fiscal years , , and , respectively. Stock-Based Compensation Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), measured the fair value the grant date and recognized expense, net estimated forfeitures, over the related service performance period. The fair value stock awards based the quoted price our common stock the grant date less the present value expected dividends not received during the vesting period. measure the fair value PSUs using Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for RSUs recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs recognized using the accelerated method. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) measured the discount the employee entitled upon purchase and recognized the period purchase. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes . and international income taxes, and interest and penalties uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported tax returns and financial statements the same year. The tax effect such temporary differences reported deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net valuation allowance when more likely than not that tax benefit will not realized. All deferred income taxes are classified long-term our consolidated balance sheets. Financial Instruments Investments consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with maturity three months less the date purchase cash equivalents. The fair values these investments approximate their carrying values. general, investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may classified short-term based their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment cash that available for current operations. PART Item Debt investments are classified available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes fair value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded other comprehensive income . Fair value calculated based publicly available market information other estimates determined management. the cost investment exceeds its fair value, evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality debt instrument issuers, and the extent which the fair value less than cost. determine credit losses, employ systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence. addition, consider specific adverse conditions related the financial health , and business outlook for, the investee. have plans sell the security more likely than not that will required sell the security before recovery , then decline fair value below cost recorded impairment charge other income (expense), net and new cost basis the investment established. market, industry, and investee conditions deteriorate, may incur future impairments. Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured fair value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured using the equity method measured cost with adjustments for observable changes price impairments (referred the measurement alternative). perform qualitative assessment periodic basis and recognize impairment there are sufficient indicators that the fair value the investment less than carrying value. Changes value are recorded other income (expense), net. Derivatives Derivative instruments are recognized either assets liabilities and measured fair value. The accounting for changes the fair value derivative depends the intended use the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated fair value hedges, gains and losses are recognized other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment effectiveness are recognized other income (expense), net. For derivative instruments designated cash flow hedges, gains and losses are initially reported component other comprehensive income and subsequently recognized other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment effectiveness are recognized other income (expense), net. For derivative instruments that are not designated hedges, gains and losses from changes fair values are primarily recognized other income (expense), net. Fair Value Measurements account for certain assets and liabilities fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels fair value based the extent which inputs used measuring fair value are observable the market. categorize each our fair value measurements one these three levels based the lowest level input that significant the fair value measurement its entirety. These levels are: • Level – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments active markets. Our Level investments include . government securities, common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded exchanges. • Level – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments active markets, quoted prices for identical similar instruments markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques ( . the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable the market can corroborated observable market data for substantially the full term the assets liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level investments include commercial paper, certificates deposit, . agency securities, foreign government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level derivative assets and liabilities include certain over-the-counter forward, option, and swap contracts. PART Item • Level – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’ estimates assumptions that market participants would use pricing the asset liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level assets and liabilities include investments corporate notes and bonds , municipal securities , and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded fair value due impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used the models are significant the fair values the assets and liabilities. measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values nonrecurring basis. The fair values these investments are determined based valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Inventories Inventories are stated average cost, subject the lower cost net realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related the purchase and production inventories. Net realizable value the estimated selling price less estimated costs completion, disposal, and transportation. regularly review inventory quantities hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility our inventory. our review indicates reduction utility below carrying value, reduce our inventory new cost basis through charge cost revenue. Property and Equipment Property and equipment stated cost less accumulated depreciation, and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter the estimated useful life the asset the lease term. The estimated useful lives our property and equipment are generally follows: computer software developed acquired for internal use, three seven years ; computer equipment, two four years ; buildings and improvements, five years ; leasehold improvements, three years ; and furniture and equipment, one years . Land not depreciated. Leases determine arrangement lease inception. Operating leases are included operating lease right- -use (“ROU”) assets, other current liabilities, and operating lease liabilities our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included property and equipment, other current liabilities, and other long-term liabilities our consolidated balance sheets. ROU assets represent our right use underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation make lease payments arising from the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized commencement date based the present value lease payments over the lease term. most our leases not provide implicit rate, generally use our incremental borrowing rate based the estimated rate interest for collateralized borrowing over similar term the lease payments commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options extend terminate the lease when reasonably certain that will exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments recognized straight-line basis over the lease term. have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such vehicles, account for the lease and non-lease components single lease component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, apply portfolio approach effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and liabilities. Goodwill Goodwill tested for impairment the reporting unit level (operating segment one level below operating segment) annual basis (May for ) and between annual tests event occurs circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value reporting unit below its carrying value. PART Item Intangible Assets Our intangible assets are subject amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period benefit, ranging from one years . evaluate the recoverability intangible assets periodically taking into account events circumstances that may warrant revised estimates useful lives that indicate the asset may impaired. Recent Accounting Guidance Accounting for Income Taxes December , the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued new standard simplify the accounting for income taxes. The guidance eliminates certain exceptions related the approach for intraperiod tax allocation, the methodology for calculating income taxes interim period, and the recognition deferred tax liabilities for outside basis differences related changes ownership equity method investments and foreign subsidiaries.
