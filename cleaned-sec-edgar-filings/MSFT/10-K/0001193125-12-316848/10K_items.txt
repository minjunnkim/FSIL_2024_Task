Whether are successful this new business model depends our execution number areas, including: \x95 continuing bring market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share; \x95 maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance our cloud-based services the growing array computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, and television-related devices; \x95 continuing enhance the attractiveness our cloud platforms third-party developers; and \x95 ensuring that our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations our customers and maintain the security their data. make significant investments new products and services that may not profitable. will continue make significant investments research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, the Microsoft Office system, Bing, Windows Phone, Windows Server, the Windows Store, the Windows Azure Services platform, Office , other cloud-based services offerings, and the Xbox entertainment platform. will also continue invest new software and hardware products, services, and technologies, such the Surface line Microsoft-designed and manufactured devices announced June . Investments new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. customers not perceive our latest offerings providing significant new functionality other value, they may reduce their purchases new software products upgrades, unfavorably impacting revenue. may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for number years, all. Moreover, new products and services may not profitable, and even they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not high the margins have experienced historically. PART Item fall , are launching Windows , major new release our operating system that seeks deliver unique user experience through well-integrated software, hardware, and services. Its success depends number factors including the extent which customers embrace its new user interface and functionality, successfully coordinating with our OEM partners releasing variety hardware devices that take advantage its features, and attracting developers scale ensure competitive array quality applications. expect incur substantial marketing costs launching Window and associated services and devices, which may reduce our operating margins. may not able adequately protect our intellectual property rights. Protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use software and other intellectual property difficult. While piracy adversely affects . revenue, the impact revenue from outside the . more significant, particularly countries where laws are less protective intellectual property rights. result, our revenue these markets may grow slower than the underlying market. Similarly, the absence harmonized patent laws makes more difficult ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, actively educate consumers about the benefits licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and educate lawmakers about the advantages business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. However, continued educational and enforcement efforts may fail enhance revenue. Reductions the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue. Third parties may claim infringe their intellectual property rights. From time time, receive notices from others claiming infringe their intellectual property rights. The number these claims may grow because constant technological change the segments which compete, the extensive patent coverage existing technologies, and the rapid rate issuance new patents. resolve these claims may enter into royalty and licensing agreements terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling redesign affected products, pay damages satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins decline. addition money damages, some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products that have infringing technologies. some countries, such Germany, injunction can issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity the underlying patents. have made and expect continue making significant expenditures settle claims related the use technology and intellectual property rights and procure intellectual property rights part our strategy manage this risk. may not able protect our source code from copying there unauthorized disclosure source code. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, critical our business. Although license portions our application and operating system source code number licensees, take significant measures protect the secrecy large portions our source code. unauthorized disclosure significant portion our source code occurs, could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. This could make easier for third parties compete with our products copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure source code also could increase the security risks described the next paragraph. Cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, harm our competitive position. Security Microsoft\x92 information technology. Maintaining the security computers and computer networks paramount for and our customers. Threats information technology (\x93 \x94) security can take variety forms. Hackers develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products and services and gain access our networks and data centers. Groups hackers may also act coordinated manner launch distributed denial service attacks, other coordinated attacks. Sophisticated organizations individuals may launch targeted attacks using novel methods gain access computers running our software. These threats may result breaches our network data security, disruptions our internal systems and business applications, impairment our ability provide services our customers, product development delays, harm our competitive position from the compromise confidential business information, other negative impacts our business. PART Item addition, our internal environment continues evolve. Often are early adopters new devices and technologies. embrace new ways sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. These practices can enhance efficiency and business insight, but they also present risks that our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with the speed these changes. Security our customers\x92 products and services . Security threats are particular challenge companies like whose business technology products and services. The threats our own infrastructure also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud services rely the security our infrastructure ensure the reliability our services and the protection their data. Hackers tend focus their efforts the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many ours, and expect them continue . The security our products and services important consideration our customers\x92 purchasing decisions. devote significant resources defend against security threats, both our internal systems and those our customers. These include: \x95 engineering more secure products and services; \x95 enhancing security and reliability features our products and services, and continuously evaluating and updating those security and reliability features; \x95 improving the deployment software updates address security vulnerabilities; \x95 investing mitigation technologies that help secure customers from attacks even when such software updates are not deployed; \x95 protecting the digital security infrastructure that ensures the integrity our products and services; \x95 helping our customers make the best use our products and services protect against computer viruses and other attacks; and \x95 providing customers online automated security tools, published security guidance, and security software such firewalls and anti-virus software. The cost these steps could reduce our operating margins. Despite these efforts, actual perceived security vulnerabilities our products and services could cause significant reputational harm and lead some customers reduce delay future purchases products subscriptions services, use competing products. Customers may also increase their expenditures protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption additional products services. Any these actions customers could adversely affect our revenue. Actual perceived vulnerabilities may lead claims against . Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate limit our exposure such liability, there assurance these provisions will withstand all legal challenges. Legislative regulatory action may increase the costs develop implement our products and services. Improper disclosure personal data could result liability and harm our reputation. continue execute our strategy increasing the number and scale our cloud-based offerings, store and process increasingly large amounts personally identifiable information our customers. the same time, the continued occurrence high-profile data breaches provides evidence external environment increasingly hostile information security. This environment demands that continuously improve our design and coordination security controls across our business groups and geographies. Despite these efforts, possible our security controls over personal data, our training employees and vendors data security, and other practices follow may not prevent the improper disclosure personally identifiable information that our vendors store and manage. Improper disclosure this information could harm our reputation, lead legal exposure customers, subject liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting increased costs loss revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers store and process personal data premise , increasingly, cloud-based environment host. believe consumers using our email, messaging, storage, sharing, and social networking services will increasingly want efficient, centralized methods choosing their privacy preferences and controlling their data. Perceptions that our products services not adequately protect the PART Item privacy personal information could inhibit sales our products services, and could constrain consumer and business adoption our cloud-based solutions. may experience outages, data losses, and disruptions our online services fail maintain adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic and complexity our products and services demand more computing power. have spent and expect continue spend substantial amounts purchase lease data centers and equipment and upgrade our technology and network infrastructure handle increased traffic our websites and our data centers, and introduce new products and services and support existing services such Bing, Exchange Online, Office , SharePoint Online, Skype, Xbox LIVE, Windows Azure, Windows Live, and Microsoft Office Web Apps. also are growing our business providing platform and back-end hosting for services provided third-party businesses their end customers. Maintaining and expanding this infrastructure expensive and complex. Inefficiencies operational failures, including temporary permanent loss customer data, could diminish the quality our products, services, and user experience resulting contractual liability, claims customers and other third parties, damage our reputation and loss current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each which may harm our operating results and financial condition. are subject government litigation and regulatory activity that affects how design and market our products. leading global software maker, receive close scrutiny from government agencies under . and foreign competition laws. Some jurisdictions also provide private rights action for competitors consumers assert claims anti-competitive conduct. For example, have been involved the following actions. Lawsuits brought the . Department Justice, states, and the District Columbia two separate actions were resolved through Consent Decree that took effect and Final Judgment entered . These proceedings imposed various constraints our Windows operating system businesses. These constraints included limits certain contracting practices, mandated disclosure certain software program interfaces and protocols, and rights for computer manufacturers limit the visibility certain Windows features new PCs. Although the Consent Decree and Final Judgment expired May , expect that federal and state antitrust authorities will continue closely scrutinize our business. The European Commission closely scrutinizes the design high-volume Microsoft products and the terms which make certain technologies used these products, such file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available other companies. , the Commission ordered create new versions Windows that not include certain multimedia technologies and provide our competitors with specifications for how implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols their own products. , the Commission accepted set commitments offered Microsoft address the Commission\x92 concerns relating competition Web browsing software. The Commission\x92 impact product design may limit our ability innovate Windows other products the future, diminish the developer appeal the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability licenses related protocols and file formats may enable competitors develop software products that better mimic the functionality our own products which could result decreased sales our products. Government regulatory actions and court decisions such these may hinder our ability provide the benefits our software consumers and businesses, thereby reducing the attractiveness our products and the revenue that come from them. New actions could initiated any time, either these other governments private claimants, including with respect new versions Windows other Microsoft products. The outcome such actions, steps taken avoid them, could adversely affect variety ways, including: \x95 may have choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies avoid fines designing and developing alternative versions those products comply with government rulings, which may entail delay product release and removing functionality that customers want which developers rely. \x95 may required make available licenses our proprietary technologies terms that not reflect their fair market value not protect our associated intellectual property. \x95 The rulings described above may used precedent other competition law proceedings. PART Item \x95 are subject variety ongoing commitments result court administrative orders, consent decrees other voluntary actions have taken. fail comply with these commitments may incur litigation costs and subject fines other remedial actions. For example, July announced that, for some PCs sold Europe, were not compliance with our agreement display \x93Browser Choice Screen\x94 Windows PCs where Internet Explorer the default browser. Our products and online services offerings, including new technologies develop acquire such Skype, are subject government regulation some jurisdictions, including areas user privacy, telecommunications, data protection, and online content. The application these laws and regulations our business often unclear, subject change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction jurisdiction. Additionally these laws and governments\x92 approach their enforcement, well our products and services, are continuing evolve. Compliance with these types regulation may involve significant costs require changes products business practices that result reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result penalties being imposed orders that stop the alleged noncompliant activity. Our business depends our ability attract and retain talented employees. Our business based successfully attracting and retaining talented employees.

Effective succession planning also important our long-term success. Failure ensure effective transfer knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. Delays product development schedules may adversely affect our revenue. The development software products complex and time-consuming process. New products and enhancements existing products can require long development and testing periods. Our increasing focus cloud-based software plus services also presents new and complex development issues. Significant delays new product service releases significant problems creating new products services could adversely affect our revenue. make significant investments new products and services that may not profitable. Our growth depends our ability create new and higher value product and service offerings. will continue make significant investments research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, the Microsoft Office system, Bing, Windows Phone, Windows Server, the Windows Store, the Windows Azure Services platform, Office , other cloud-based services offerings, and the Xbox entertainment platform. June , announced the Surface line Microsoft-designed and manufactured devices. will also continue invest new software and hardware products, services, and technologies. Investments new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. Our degree success with Windows Phone, for example, will impact our ability grow our share the smartphone operating system market. will also important factor supporting our strategy delivering value end users seamlessly over variety form factors including , phone, and device classes. customers not perceive our latest offerings providing significant new functionality other value, they may reduce their purchases new software products upgrades, unfavorably impacting revenue. may not achieve significant revenue from new product and service investments for number years, all. Moreover, new products and services may not profitable, and even they are profitable, operating margins for new products and businesses may not high the margins have experienced historically. Adverse economic conditions may harm our business. Unfavorable changes economic conditions, including inflation, recession, other changes economic conditions, may result lower information technology spending and adversely affect our revenue. demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, consumer business spending for those products declines, our revenue will adversely affected. Our product distribution system also relies extensive partner and retail network. Original equipment manufacturers (\x93OEMs\x94) building devices that run our software have also been significant means distribution. The impact economic conditions our partners, such the bankruptcy major distributor, OEM, retailer, could result sales channel disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability our customers pay for products and PART Item services they have purchased. result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs accounts receivable may increase. maintain investment portfolio various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may exacerbated unusual events that have affected global financial markets. significant part our investment portfolio consists . government securities. global credit and equity markets experience prolonged periods decline, there downgrade . government debt, our investment portfolio may adversely impacted and could determine that more our investments have experienced other-than-temporary decline fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results. have claims and lawsuits against that may result adverse outcomes. are subject variety claims and lawsuits.

The new guidance provides entity the option first perform qualitative assessment determine whether more likely than not that the fair value reporting unit less than its carrying amount. entity determines that this the case, required perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount goodwill impairment loss recognized for that reporting unit ( any). entity determines that the fair value reporting unit greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test not required. The new guidance will effective for beginning July , . June , the FASB issued guidance presentation comprehensive income. The new guidance eliminates the current option report other comprehensive income and its components the statement changes stockholders\x92 equity. Instead, entity will required present either continuous statement net income and PART Item other comprehensive income two separate but consecutive statements. This portion the guidance will effective for beginning July , and will require financial statement presentation changes only. The new guidance also required entities present reclassification adjustments out accumulated other comprehensive income component both the statement which net income presented and the statement which other comprehensive income presented. However, December , the FASB issued guidance that indefinitely defers the guidance related the presentation reclassification adjustments. APPLICATION CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared accordance with . GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected management\x92 application accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for include revenue recognition, impairment investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and stock-based compensation. Revenue Recognition Software revenue recognition requires judgment, including whether software arrangement includes multiple elements, and , whether vendor-specific objective evidence (\x93VSOE\x94) fair value exists for those elements. portion revenue may recorded unearned due undelivered elements. Changes the elements software arrangement, the ability identify VSOE for those elements, and the fair value the respective elements could materially impact the amount earned and unearned revenue. Judgment also required assess whether future releases certain software represent new products upgrades and enhancements existing products. Windows revenue subject deferral result the Windows Upgrade Offer, which started June , . The offer provides significantly discounted rights purchase Windows Pro qualifying end users that purchase Windows PCs during the eligibility period. Microsoft responsible for delivering Windows Pro the end customer. Accordingly, revenue related the allocated discount for undelivered Windows deferred until delivered the redemption period expires. Impairment Investment Securities review investments quarterly for indicators other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. making this judgment, employ systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence evaluating potential impairment our investments. the cost investment exceeds its fair value, evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent which the fair value less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability hold, plans sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, also evaluate whether have plans sell the security more likely than not that will required sell the security before recovery. also consider specific adverse conditions related the financial health and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once decline fair value determined other-than-temporary, impairment charge recorded other income (expense) and new cost basis the investment established. market, industry, and investee conditions deteriorate, may incur future impairments. Goodwill allocate goodwill reporting units based the reporting unit expected benefit from the business combination. evaluate our reporting units annual basis and, necessary, reassign goodwill using relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill tested for impairment the reporting unit level (operating segment one level below operating segment) annual basis (May for ) and between annual tests event occurs circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value reporting unit below its carrying value. These events circumstances could include significant change the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale disposition significant portion reporting unit. PART Item Application the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification reporting units, assignment assets and liabilities reporting units, assignment goodwill reporting units, and determination the fair value each reporting unit. The fair value each reporting unit estimated using discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation future cash flows, which dependent internal forecasts, estimation the long-term rate growth for our business, estimation the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination our weighted average cost capital. The estimates used calculate the fair value reporting unit change from year year based operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally researching and developing computer software product are charged expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility established, all software costs are capitalized until the product available for general release customers. Judgment required determining when technological feasibility product established. have determined that technological feasibility for our software products reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released manufacturing. The amortization these costs included cost revenue over the estimated life the products. Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes legal proceedings and claims brought against are subject significant uncertainty. estimated loss from loss contingency such legal proceeding claim accrued charge income probable that asset has been impaired liability has been incurred and the amount the loss can reasonably estimated. Disclosure contingency required there least reasonable possibility that loss has been incurred. determining whether loss should accrued evaluate, among other factors, the degree probability unfavorable outcome and the ability make reasonable estimate the amount loss. Changes these factors could materially impact our financial statements. Income Taxes The objectives accounting for income taxes are recognize the amount taxes payable refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences events that have been recognized entity\x92 financial statements tax returns. recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax position only more likely than not that the tax position will sustained examination the taxing authorities, based the technical merits the position. The tax benefits recognized the financial statements from such position are measured based the largest benefit that has greater than % likelihood being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance derecognition income tax assets and liabilities, classification current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment required assessing the future tax consequences events that have been recognized our financial statements tax returns. Variations the actual outcome these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial statements. Stock-Based Compensation Stock-based compensation cost measured the grant date based the fair value the award and recognized expense, net estimated forfeitures, over the requisite service period. Determining the fair value stock-based awards the grant date requires judgment, including estimating expected dividends. addition, judgment also required estimating the amount stock-based awards that are expected forfeited. actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results operations could impacted.

PART Item NOTES FINANCIAL STATEMENTS NOTE \x97 ACCOUNTING POLICIES Accounting Principles The financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared accordance with accounting principles generally accepted the United States America (\x93 . GAAP\x94). Principles Consolidation The financial statements include the accounts Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which exercise significant influence over but not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary the investee\x92 activities are accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which are not able exercise significant influence over the investee and which not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value , and potential goodwill impairment for, our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples assumptions include: the elements comprising software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility achieved for our products; the potential outcome future tax consequences events that have been recognized our financial statements tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management\x92 estimates and assumptions. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded foreign currencies are translated the exchange rate the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated average rates exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded Other Comprehensive Income (\x93OCI\x94). Revenue Recognition Revenue recognized when persuasive evidence arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee fixed determinable, and collectibility probable. Revenue generally recognized net allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted governmental authorities. Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed original equipment manufacturers (\x93OEMs\x94), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally recognized products are shipped made available. Revenue for products under technology guarantee programs, which provide free significantly discounted rights use upcoming new versions software product end user licenses existing versions the product during the eligibility period, allocated between existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated the new product deferred until that version delivered. The revenue allocation based vendor-specific objective evidence fair value the products. Certain multi-year licensing arrangements include perpetual license for current products combined with rights receive future versions software products when-and- -available basis (\x93Software Assurance\x94) and are accounted for subscriptions, with billings recorded unearned revenue and recognized revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. Revenue from certain arrangements that allow for the use product service over period time without taking possession software are also accounted for subscriptions. Revenue for software PART Item products where customers have the right receive unspecified upgrades enhancements when-and- -available basis and for which vendor-specific objective evidence fair value does not exist for the upgrades enhancements recognized straight-line basis over the estimated life the software. Revenue related our Xbox gaming and entertainment console, Kinect for Xbox , games published , and other hardware components generally recognized when ownership transferred the resellers. Revenue related games published third parties for use the Xbox platform recognized when games are manufactured the game publishers. Display advertising revenue recognized advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue recognized when the appears the search results when the action necessary earn the revenue has been completed. Consulting services revenue recognized services are rendered, generally based the negotiated hourly rate the consulting arrangement and the number hours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements recognized services are provided. Revenue from prepaid points redeemable for the purchase software services recognized upon redemption the points and delivery the software services. Cost Revenue Cost revenue includes; manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred include software PCs sold OEMs, drive traffic our websites, and acquire online advertising space (\x93traffic acquisition costs\x94); costs incurred support and maintain Internet-based products and services, including royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery consulting services; and the amortization capitalized research and development costs. Capitalized research and development costs are amortized over the estimated lives the products. Product Warranty provide for the estimated costs fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties the time the related revenue recognized. For hardware warranties, estimate the costs based historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge specific product failures ( any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country which business, but generally include parts and labor over period generally ranging from days three years. For software warranties, estimate the costs provide bug fixes, such security patches, over the estimated life the software. regularly reevaluate our estimates assess the adequacy the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts necessary. Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred translate software for international markets, and the amortization purchased software code and services content. Such costs related software development are included research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility reached, which for our software products, generally shortly before the products are released manufacturing. Once technological feasibility reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized cost revenue over the estimated lives the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed incurred. Advertising expense was $ billion, $ billion, and $ billion fiscal years , , and , respectively. PART Item Stock-Based Compensation measure stock-based compensation cost the grant date based the fair value the award and recognize expense, net estimated forfeitures, over the vesting service period, applicable, the stock award (generally four five years) using the straight-line method. Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares our common stock may purchased employees three-month intervals % the fair market value the stock the last day each three-month period. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan measured the discount the employee entitled upon purchase and recognized the period purchase. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes . and international income taxes, the provision for . taxes undistributed earnings international subsidiaries not deemed permanently invested, and interest and penalties uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported tax returns and financial statements the same year. The tax effect such temporary differences reported deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net valuation allowance when more likely than not that tax benefit will not realized. The deferred income taxes are classified current long-term based the classification the related asset liability. Fair Value Measurements account for certain assets and liabilities fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels fair value based the extent which inputs used measuring fair value are observable the market. categorize each our fair value measurements one these three levels based the lowest level input that significant the fair value measurement its entirety. These levels are: \x95 Level \x96 inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded active markets. Our Level non-derivative investments primarily include . treasuries, domestic and international equities, and actively traded mutual funds. Our Level derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded exchanges. \x95 Level \x96 inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments active markets, quoted prices for identical similar instruments markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques ( . the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable the market can corroborated observable market data for substantially the full term the assets liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Our Level non-derivative investments consist primarily corporate notes and bonds, mortgage-backed securities, agency securities, certificates deposit, and commercial paper. Our Level derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts. \x95 Level \x96 inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\x92 estimates assumptions that market participants would use pricing the asset liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level non-derivative assets primarily comprise investments certain corporate bonds and goodwill when recorded fair value due impairment charge. value the Level corporate bonds using internally developed valuation models, inputs which include interest rate curves, credit spreads, stock prices, and volatilities. Our Level derivative assets and liabilities primarily comprise derivatives for foreign equities. certain cases, market-based observable inputs are not available and use management judgment develop assumptions determine fair value for these derivatives. Unobservable inputs used all these models are significant the fair values the assets and liabilities. PART Item measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, fair value nonrecurring basis when they are deemed other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values these investments are determined based valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. impairment charge recorded when the cost the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition determined other-than-temporary. Our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. Financial Instruments consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with maturity three months less the date purchase cash equivalents. The fair values these investments approximate their carrying values. general, investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may classified short-term based their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment cash that available for current operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected OCI. Equity and other investments classified long-term include both debt and equity instruments. Debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected OCI. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year are not publicly traded are recorded cost using the equity method. lend certain fixed-income and equity securities increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue carried investments our balance sheet. Cash and security interests are received collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness the borrower. Cash received recorded asset with corresponding liability. Investments are considered impaired when decline fair value judged other-than-temporary. Fair value calculated based publicly available market information other estimates determined management. employ systematic methodology quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence evaluating potential impairment our investments. the cost investment exceeds its fair value, evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent which the fair value less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability hold, plans sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, also evaluate whether have plans sell the security more likely than not that will required sell the security before recovery. also consider specific adverse conditions related the financial health and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once decline fair value determined other-than-temporary, impairment charge recorded other income (expense) and new cost basis the investment established. Derivative instruments are recognized either assets liabilities and are measured fair value. The accounting for changes the fair value derivative depends the intended use the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated fair-value hedges, the gain (loss) recognized earnings the period change together with the offsetting loss gain the hedged items attributed the risk being hedged. For options designated fair-value hedges, changes the time value are excluded from the assessment hedge effectiveness and are recognized earnings. PART Item For derivative instruments designated cash-flow hedges, the effective portion the derivative\x92 gain (loss) initially reported component OCI and subsequently recognized earnings when the hedged exposure recognized earnings. For options designated cash-flow hedges, changes the time value are excluded from the assessment hedge effectiveness and are recognized earnings. Gains (losses) derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment effectiveness hedge ineffectiveness are recognized earnings. For derivative instruments that are not designated hedges, gains (losses) from changes fair values are primarily recognized other income (expense). Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset unrealized gains (losses) the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded component OCI until the securities are sold other-than-temporarily impaired, which time the amounts are moved from OCI into other income (expense). Allowance for Doubtful Accounts The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate probable losses inherent the accounts receivable balance. determine the allowance based known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently available evidence. Activity the allowance for doubtful accounts was follows: ( millions) Year Ended June , Balance, beginning period $ $ $ Charged costs and other Write-offs ( ) ( ) ( ) Balance, end period $ $ $ Inventories Inventories are stated the lower cost market, using the average cost method. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related the purchase and production inventories. regularly review inventory quantities hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility our inventory. our review indicates reduction utility below carrying value, reduce our inventory new cost basis through charge cost revenue. Property and Equipment Property and equipment stated cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter the estimated useful life the asset the lease term. The estimated useful lives our property and equipment are generally follows: computer software developed acquired for internal use, three years; computer equipment, two three years; buildings and improvements, five years; leasehold improvements, two years; and furniture and equipment, one five years. Land not depreciated. Goodwill Goodwill tested for impairment the reporting unit level (operating segment one level below operating segment) annual basis (May for ) and between annual tests event occurs circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value reporting unit below its carrying value. PART Item Intangible Assets All our intangible assets are subject amortization and are amortized using the straight-line method over their estimated period benefit, ranging from one years. evaluate the recoverability intangible assets periodically taking into account events circumstances that may warrant revised estimates useful lives that indicate the asset may impaired. Recent Accounting Guidance Recently adopted accounting guidance July , , adopted guidance issued the Financial Accounting Standards Board (\x93FASB\x94) disclosure requirements related fair value measurements. The guidance requires the disclosure roll-forward activities purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements the assets and liabilities measured using significant unobservable inputs (Level fair value measurements). Adoption this new guidance did not have material impact our financial statements. January , , adopted guidance issued the FASB accounting and disclosure requirements related fair value measurements. The guidance limits the highest-and-best-use measure nonfinancial assets, permits certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions market counterparty credit risks measured net basis, and provides guidance the applicability premiums and discounts. Additionally, the guidance expands the disclosures Level inputs requiring quantitative disclosure the unobservable inputs and assumptions, well description the valuation processes and the sensitivity the fair value changes unobservable inputs. Adoption this new guidance did not have material impact our financial statements. Recent accounting guidance not yet adopted December , the FASB issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature entity\x92 right offset and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure the gross amounts subject rights set-off, amounts offset accordance with the accounting standards followed, and the related net exposure. The new guidance will effective for beginning July , . Other than requiring additional disclosures, not anticipate material impacts our financial statements upon adoption. September , the FASB issued guidance testing goodwill for impairment. The new guidance provides entity the option first perform qualitative assessment determine whether more likely than not that the fair value reporting unit less than its carrying amount. entity determines that this the case, required perform the currently prescribed two-step goodwill impairment test identify potential goodwill impairment and measure the amount goodwill impairment loss recognized for that reporting unit ( any). entity determines that the fair value reporting unit greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment test not required. The new guidance will effective for beginning July , . June , the FASB issued guidance presentation comprehensive income. The new guidance eliminates the current option report other comprehensive income and its components the statement changes stockholders\x92 equity. Instead, entity will required present either continuous statement net income and other comprehensive income two separate but consecutive statements. This portion the guidance will effective for beginning July , and will require financial statement presentation changes only. The new guidance also required entities present reclassification adjustments out accumulated other comprehensive income component both the statement which net income presented and the statement which other comprehensive income presented. However, December , the FASB issued guidance which indefinitely defers the guidance related the presentation reclassification adjustments.
