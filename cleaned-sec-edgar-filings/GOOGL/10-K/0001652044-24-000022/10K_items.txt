Fair Value Measurements Fair value exit price, representing the amount that would received sell asset paid transfer liability orderly transaction between market participants. such, fair value market-based measurement that determined based assumptions that market participants would use pricing asset liability. Assets and liabilities recorded fair value are measured and classified accordance with three-tier fair value hierarchy based the observability the inputs available the market used measure fair value: Level - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets liabilities active markets. . Alphabet Inc. Level - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments active markets, quoted prices for identical similar instruments markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable the market can derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings. Level - Unobservable inputs that are supported little market activities. The fair value hierarchy requires entity maximize the use observable inputs and minimize the use unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. The determination fair value involves the use appropriate valuation methods and relevant inputs into valuation models. Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured fair value recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative financial instruments, and certain non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets measured fair value nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities. Other financial assets and liabilities are carried cost with fair value disclosed, required. measure certain other instruments, including SBC awards settled the stock Other Bet companies, and certain assets and liabilities acquired business combination, also fair value nonrecurring basis.

Derivative Financial Instruments See Note for the accounting policy pertaining derivative financial instruments. Accounts Receivable Our payment terms for accounts receivable vary the types and locations our customers and the products services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment due not significant. For certain products services and customers, require payment before the products services are delivered the customer. Additionally, accounts receivable includes amounts for services performed advance the right invoice the customer. maintain allowance for credit losses for accounts receivable, which recorded offset accounts receivable, and changes such are classified general and administrative expense the Consolidated Statements Income. assess collectibility reviewing accounts receivable collective basis where similar characteristics exist and individual basis when identify specific customers with known disputes collectibility issues. determining the amount the allowance for credit losses, consider historical collectibility based past due status and make judgments about the creditworthiness customers based ongoing credit evaluations. also consider customer-specific information, current market conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts future economic conditions. Other Our financial instruments also include debt and equity investments companies with which also entered into commercial arrangements near the same time. For these transactions, judgment required assessing the substance the arrangements, including assessing whether the components the arrangements should accounted for separate transactions under the applicable GAAP, and determining the value the components the arrangements, including the fair value the investments. Additionally, our investment such companies becomes impaired, any remaining performance obligations would reassessed and may reduced. Impairment Investments periodically review our debt and non-marketable equity securities for impairment. For debt securities unrealized loss position, determine whether credit loss exists. The credit loss estimated considering available information relevant the collectibility the security and information about past events, current conditions, and reasonable and supportable forecasts. Any credit loss recorded charge & , not exceed the amount the unrealized loss. Unrealized losses other than the credit loss are recognized AOCI. have intent sell, more likely than not that will required sell debt security unrealized loss position before recovery its amortized cost basis, will write down the security its fair value and record the corresponding charge component & . For non-marketable equity securities, including equity method investments, consider whether impairment indicators exist evaluating the companies\' financial and liquidity position and access capital resources, among other indicators. the assessment indicates that the investment impaired, write down the investment its fair value recording the corresponding charge component & . prepare quantitative measurements the fair value our equity investments using market approach income approach. Inventory Inventory consists primarily finished goods and stated the lower cost and net realizable value. Cost computed using the first- , first-out method. Variable Interest Entities determine the inception each arrangement whether entity which have made investment which have other variable interests considered variable interest entity (VIE). consolidate VIEs when are the primary beneficiary. are the primary beneficiary VIE when have the power direct activities that most significantly affect the economic performance the VIE and have the obligation absorb the majority their losses . Alphabet Inc. benefits. are not the primary beneficiary VIE, account for the investment other variable interests VIE accordance with applicable GAAP. Periodically, assess whether any changes our interest relationship with the entity affect our determination whether the entity VIE and, , whether are the primary beneficiary. Property and Equipment Property and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, construction progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, data centers, and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network equipment.

Depreciation recorded using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives the assets, which regularly evaluate. Land not depreciated. depreciate buildings over periods seven years. depreciate information technology assets generally over period six years for servers and network equipment. depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter the remaining lease term the estimated useful lives the assets. Depreciation for buildings, information technology assets, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures commences once they are ready for our intended use. Goodwill allocate goodwill reporting units based the expected benefit from the business combination. evaluate our reporting units periodically, well when changes our operating segments occur. For changes reporting units, reassign goodwill using relative fair value allocation approach. test our goodwill for impairment least annually, more frequently events changes circumstances indicate that the asset may impaired. Goodwill impairments were material for the periods presented. Leases determine arrangement lease inception. Our lease agreements generally contain lease and non-lease components. Payments under our lease arrangements are primarily fixed.
