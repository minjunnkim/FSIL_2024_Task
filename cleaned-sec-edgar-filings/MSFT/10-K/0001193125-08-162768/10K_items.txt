Commodity derivatives held for the purpose portfolio diversification are subject commodity price risk. use value- -risk (\x93VaR\x94) model estimate and quantify our market risks. VaR the expected loss, for given confidence level, fair value our portfolio due adverse market movements over defined time horizon. The VaR model not intended represent actual losses fair value, but used risk estimation and management tool. The model used for currencies, equities, and commodities geometric Brownian motion, which allows incorporation optionality with regard these risk exposures. For interest rate risk, exposures such key rate durations and spread durations are used calculations that reflect the principle that fixed-income security prices revert maturity value over time. VaR calculated computing the exposures each holding\x92 market value range over , equity, fixed-income, foreign exchange, and commodity risk factors. The exposures are then used compute the parameters distribution potential changes the total market value all holdings, taking into account the weighted historical volatilities the different rates and prices and the weighted historical correlations among the different rates and prices. The VaR then calculated the total loss that will not exceeded the percentile confidence level , alternatively stated, the losses could exceed the VaR out , cases. Several risk factors are not captured the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, credit risk, and legal risk. Certain securities our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes. hedge the value portion these securities through the use derivative contracts such put-call collars. these arrangements, hedge security\x92 equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most all the benefits the security\x92 appreciation above the sold call strike. also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes. The VaR amounts disclosed below are used risk management tool and reflect estimate potential reductions fair value our portfolio. Losses fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported VaR significant amounts and can also accumulate over longer time horizon than the specified holding period used the VaR analysis. VaR amounts are not necessarily reflective potential accounting losses, including determinations other-than-temporary losses fair value accordance with . GAAP. VaR numbers are shown separately for interest rate, currency rate, equity price, and commodity price risks. These VaR numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges. use historical data estimate VaR. Given the reliance historical data, VaR most effective estimating risk exposures markets which there are fundamental changes shifts market conditions. inherent limitation VaR that the distribution past changes market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions future market risk.

The amount revenue allocated undelivered elements based the vendor-specific objective evidence fair value for those elements using the residual method. Under the residual method, the total fair value the undelivered elements, indicated vendor-specific objective evidence, recorded unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount recorded unearned for the undelivered elements recognized revenue related delivered elements. Unearned revenue due undelivered elements recognized ratably straight-line basis over the related product\x92 life cycle. Revenue related Windows Vista not subject similar deferral because there are significant undelivered elements. Revenue from multi-year licensing arrangements are accounted for subscriptions, with billings recorded unearned revenue and recognized revenue ratably over the billing coverage period.
