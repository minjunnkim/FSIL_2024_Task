Our expenses and investments are large extent fixed, and may not able adjust our spending quickly enough our net sales fall short our expectations. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends the continued growth demand for the products offered our sellers, and our business affected general economic and business conditions throughout the world. softening demand, whether caused changes consumer preferences weakening the . global economies, may result decreased revenue growth.

North America revenue growth rate was consistent with %, from our growth rate %. The increase growth rates from reflects our efforts increase product categories and selection available our websites, and continue reducing prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers. International revenue growth rate declined and compared the prior year periods, which reflects several factors. These factors include the increasing size our business, which naturally causes growth rates decline over time, offset our customer experience initiatives including new category introductions; increased selection; the introduction our third-party offerings the , Germany, Japan, and France; and our efforts reduce prices for our customers, including from our free shipping offers. International segment revenue growth rates are also affected changes exchange rates. The relative mix worldwide net sales attributed our International segment continues increase, and expect that, over time, our International segment will represent % more our consolidated total.

Our measure \x93Free cash flow\x94 meets the definition non-GAAP financial measure. Free cash flow used addition and conjunction with results presented accordance with GAAP and free cash flow should not relied upon the exclusion GAAP financial measures. Free cash flow reflects additional way viewing our liquidity that, when viewed with our GAAP results, provides more complete understanding factors and trends affecting our cash flows. Management strongly encourages investors review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports their entirety and not rely any single financial measure. Free cash flow, which reconcile \x93Cash provided (used ) operating activities,\x94 cash flow from operations reduced \x93Purchases fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.\x94 use free cash flow, and ratios based , conduct and evaluate our business because, although similar cash flow from operations, believe more conservative measure cash flows since purchases fixed assets are necessary component ongoing operations. limited circumstances which proceeds from sales fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since not anticipate being net seller fixed assets, expect free cash flow less than operating cash flows. Free cash flow has limitations due the fact that does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.

However, since not anticipate being net seller fixed assets, expect free cash flow less than operating cash flows. Free cash flow has limitations due the fact that does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.
