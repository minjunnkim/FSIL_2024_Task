Risks Related Our Business and Industry fail retain existing users add new users, our users decrease their level engagement with our products, our revenue, financial results, and business may significantly harmed. The size our user base and our users\' level engagement are critical our success. Our financial performance has been and will continue significantly determined our success adding, retaining, and engaging active users our products, particularly for Facebook and Instagram. anticipate that our active user growth rate will generally decline over time the size our active user base increases, and expect that the size our active user base will fluctuate decline one more markets from time time, particularly markets where have achieved higher penetration rates. For example, the fourth quarter , experienced slight decline quarter-over-quarter basis the number daily active users Facebook the United States & Canada region. people not perceive our products useful, reliable, and trustworthy, may not able attract retain users otherwise maintain increase the frequency and duration their engagement. number other social networking companies that achieved early popularity have since seen their active user bases levels engagement decline, some cases precipitously. There guarantee that will not experience similar erosion our active user base engagement levels. Our user engagement patterns have changed over time, and user engagement can difficult measure, particularly introduce new and different products and services. Any number factors can negatively affect user retention, growth, and engagement, including : • users increasingly engage with other competitive products services; • fail introduce new features, products services that users find engaging introduce new products services, make changes existing products and services, that are not favorably received; • users feel that their experience diminished result the decisions make with respect the frequency, prominence, format, size, and quality ads that display; • users have difficulty installing, updating, otherwise accessing our products mobile devices result actions third parties that rely distribute our products and deliver our services; • user behavior any our products changes, including decreases the quality and frequency content shared our products and services; • are unable continue develop products for mobile devices that users find engaging, that work with variety mobile operating systems and networks, and that achieve high level market acceptance; • there are decreases user sentiment due questions about the quality usefulness our products our user data practices, concerns related privacy and sharing, safety, security, well-being, other factors; • are unable manage and prioritize information ensure users are presented with content that appropriate, interesting, useful, and relevant them; • are unable obtain attract engaging third-party content; • are unable successfully maintain grow usage and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products; • users adopt new technologies where our products may displaced favor other products services, may not featured otherwise available; • there are changes mandated legislation, regulatory authorities, litigation that adversely affect our products users; • there decreased engagement with our products, failure accept our terms service, part changes that implemented connection with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) Europe, other similar changes that implemented the United States and around the world, other changes have implemented may implement the future connection with other regulations, regulatory actions otherwise; • technical other problems prevent from delivering our products rapid and reliable manner otherwise affect the user experience, such security breaches failure prevent limit spam similar content; • adopt terms, policies, procedures related areas such sharing, content, user data, advertising that are perceived negatively our users the general public; • elect focus our product decisions longer-term initiatives that not prioritize near-term user growth and engagement; • make changes how promote different products and services across our family products; • initiatives designed attract and retain users and engagement are unsuccessful discontinued, whether result actions , third parties, otherwise; • third-party initiatives that may enable greater use our products, including low-cost discounted data plans, are discontinued; • there decreased engagement with our products result taxes imposed the use social media other mobile applications certain countries, internet shutdowns, other actions governments that affect the accessibility our products their countries; • fail provide adequate customer service users, marketers, developers, other partners; • , developers whose products are integrated with our products, other partners and companies our industry are the subject adverse media reports other negative publicity, including result our their user data practices; • our current future products, such our development tools and application programming interfaces that enable developers build, grow, and monetize mobile and web applications, reduce user activity our products making easier for our users interact and share third-party mobile and web applications. From time time, certain these factors have negatively affected user retention, growth, and engagement varying degrees. are unable maintain increase our user base and user engagement, our revenue and financial results may adversely affected. Any decrease user retention, growth, engagement could render our products less attractive users, marketers, and developers, which likely have material and adverse impact our revenue, business, financial condition, and results operations. our active user growth rate continues slow, will become increasingly dependent our ability maintain increase levels user engagement and monetization order drive revenue growth. generate substantially all our revenue from advertising. The loss marketers, reduction spending marketers, could seriously harm our business. Substantially all our revenue currently generated from third parties advertising Facebook and Instagram. common the industry, our marketers not have long-term advertising commitments with . Many our marketers spend only relatively small portion their overall advertising budget with . Marketers will not continue business with , they will reduce the budgets they are willing commit , not deliver ads effective manner, they not believe that their investment advertising with will generate competitive return relative other alternatives. have recently implemented, and will continue implement, changes our user data practices. Some these changes reduce our ability effectively target ads, which has some extent adversely affected, and will continue adversely affect, our advertising business. are unable provide marketers with suitable return investment, the pricing our ads may not increase, may decline, which case our revenue and financial results may harmed. Our advertising revenue can also adversely affected number other factors, including: • decreases user engagement, including time spent our products; • our inability continue increase user access and engagement with our products; • product changes inventory management decisions may make that change the size, format, frequency, relative prominence ads displayed our products other unpaid content shared marketers our products; • our inability maintain increase marketer demand, the pricing our ads, both; • our inability maintain increase the quantity quality ads shown users, including result technical infrastructure constraints; • user behavior product changes that may reduce traffic features products that successfully monetize, including result our efforts promote the Stories format increased usage our messaging products; • reductions advertising marketers due our efforts implement advertising policies that protect the security and integrity our platform; • changes third-party policies that limit our ability deliver, target, measure the effectiveness advertising; • the availability, accuracy, utility, and security analytics and measurement solutions offered third parties that demonstrate the value our ads marketers, our ability further improve such tools; • loss advertising market share our competitors, including prices purchase our ads increase competitors offer lower priced, more integrated otherwise more effective products; • adverse government actions legislative, regulatory, other legal developments relating advertising, including developments that may impact our ability deliver, target, measure the effectiveness advertising; • decisions marketers reduce their advertising result adverse media reports other negative publicity involving , our user data practices, our advertising metrics tools, content our products, developers with mobile and web applications that are integrated with our products, other companies our industry; • reductions advertising marketers due objectionable content published our products third parties, questions about our user data practices, concerns about brand safety potential legal liability, uncertainty regarding their own legal and compliance obligations; • the effectiveness our targeting degree which users opt out certain types targeting, including result product changes and controls that implemented connection with the GDPR, California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), other similar changes that implemented the United States and around the world (for example, have seen increasing number users opt out certain types targeting Europe following adoption the GDPR), other product changes controls have implemented may implement the future, whether connection with other regulations, regulatory actions otherwise, that impact our ability target ads; • the degree which users cease reduce the number times they engage with our ads; • changes the way advertising mobile devices personal computers measured priced; • changes the composition our marketer base our inability maintain grow our marketer base; and • the impact macroeconomic conditions, whether the advertising industry general, among specific types marketers within particular geographies. From time time, certain these factors have adversely affected our advertising revenue varying degrees. The occurrence any these other factors the future could result reduction demand for our ads, which may reduce the prices receive for our ads, cause marketers stop advertising with altogether, either which would negatively affect our revenue and financial results. Our advertising revenue dependent targeting and measurement tools that incorporate data signals from user activity websites and services that not control, and changes the regulatory environment, third-party mobile operating systems and browsers, and our own products have impacted, and expect will continue impact, the availability such signals, which will adversely affect our advertising revenue. rely data signals from user activity websites and services that not control order deliver relevant and effective ads our users. Our advertising revenue dependent targeting and measurement tools that incorporate these signals, and any changes our ability use such signals will adversely affect our business. For example, legislative and regulatory changes, such the GDPR and CCPA, have impacted, and expect will continue impact, our ability use such signals our products. addition, mobile operating system and browser providers, such Apple and Google, have announced product changes well future plans limit the ability application developers use these signals target and measure advertising their platforms. Similarly, have implemented, and may continue implement, product changes that give users the ability limit our use such data signals improve ads and other experiences our products and services, including our Off-Facebook Activity tool and our worldwide offering product changes implemented connection with the GDPR. These developments have limited our ability target and measure the effectiveness ads our platform, and any additional loss such signals the future will adversely affect our targeting and measurement capabilities and negatively impact our advertising revenue. Our user growth, engagement, and monetization mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that not control. The substantial majority our revenue generated from advertising mobile devices. There guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue feature Facebook our other products, that mobile device users will continue use our products rather than competing products. are dependent the interoperability Facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, technologies, products, and standards that not control, such the Android and iOS operating systems and mobile browsers. Any changes, bugs, technical issues such systems, changes our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, browser developers, mobile carriers, their terms service policies that degrade our products\' functionality, reduce eliminate our ability update distribute our products, give preferential treatment competitive products, limit our ability deliver, target, measure the effectiveness ads, charge fees related the distribution our products our delivery ads could adversely affect the usage Facebook our other products and monetization mobile devices. For example, Apple previously released update its Safari browser that limits the use third-party cookies, which reduces our ability provide the most relevant ads our users and impacts monetization, and expect that any similar changes its, Google\' , other browser mobile platforms will further limit our ability target and measure the effectiveness ads and impact monetization. Additionally, order deliver high quality mobile products, important that our products work well with range mobile technologies, products, systems, networks, and standards that not control, and that have good relationships with handset manufacturers, mobile carriers and browser developers. may not successful maintaining developing relationships with key participants the mobile ecosystem developing products that operate effectively with these technologies, products, systems, networks, standards. the event that more difficult for our users access and use Facebook our other products their mobile devices, our users choose not access use Facebook our other products their mobile devices use mobile products that not offer access Facebook our other products, our user growth and user engagement could harmed. From time time, may also take actions regarding the distribution our products the operation our business based what believe our long-term best interests. Such actions may adversely affect our users and our relationships with the operators mobile operating systems, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, browser developers, other business partners, and there assurance that these actions will result the anticipated long-term benefits. the event that our users are adversely affected these actions our relationships with such third parties deteriorate, our user growth, engagement, and monetization could adversely affected and our business could harmed. Our business highly competitive. Competition presents ongoing threat the success our business. compete with companies that sell advertising, well with companies that provide social, media, and communication products and services that are designed engage users mobile devices and online. face significant competition every aspect our business, including from companies that facilitate communication and the sharing content and information, companies that enable marketers display advertising, companies that distribute video and other forms media content, and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers. compete with companies that offer products across broad platforms that replicate capabilities provide. For example, among other areas, compete with Apple messaging, Google and YouTube advertising and video, Tencent and Snap messaging and social media, Bytedance and Twitter social media, and Amazon advertising. also compete with companies that provide regional social networks and messaging products, many which have strong positions particular countries. Some our competitors may domiciled different countries and subject political, legal, and regulatory regimes that enable them compete more effectively than . addition, face competition from traditional, online, and mobile businesses that provide media for marketers reach their audiences and develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. also compete with companies that develop and deliver consumer hardware and virtual reality products and services. Some our current and potential competitors may have greater resources stronger competitive positions certain product segments, geographic regions, user demographics than . These factors may allow our competitors respond more effectively than new emerging technologies and changes market conditions. believe that some users, particularly younger users, are aware and actively engaging with other products and services similar , substitute for, our products and services, and believe that some users have reduced their use and engagement with our products and services favor these other products and services. the event that users increasingly engage with other products and services, may experience decline use and engagement key user demographics more broadly, which case our business would likely harmed. Our competitors may develop products, features, services that are similar ours that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts marketing campaigns, may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. addition, developers whose mobile and web applications are integrated with Facebook our other products may use information shared our users through our products order develop products features that compete with . Some competitors may gain competitive advantage against areas where operate, including: making acquisitions; limiting our ability deliver, target, measure the effectiveness ads; imposing fees other charges related our delivery ads; making access our products more difficult impossible; making more difficult communicate with our users; integrating competing platforms, applications, features into products they control such mobile device operating systems, search engines, browsers, -commerce platforms. For example, each Apple and Google have integrated competitive products with iOS and Android, respectively. result, our competitors may acquire and engage users generate advertising other revenue the expense our own efforts, which may negatively affect our business and financial results. addition, from time time, may take actions response competitive threats, but cannot assure you that these actions will successful that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results. believe that our ability compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including: • the popularity, usefulness, ease use, performance, and reliability our products compared our competitors\' products; • the size and composition our user base; • the engagement users with our products and competing products; • the timing and market acceptance products, including developments and enhancements our our competitors\' products; • our safety and security efforts and our ability protect user data and provide users with control over their data; • our ability distribute our products new and existing users; • our ability monetize our products; • the frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence the ads displayed our competitors; • customer service and support efforts; • marketing and selling efforts, including our ability measure the effectiveness our ads and provide marketers with compelling return their investments; • our ability establish and maintain developers\' interest building mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products; • our ability establish and maintain publisher interest integrating their content with Facebook and our other products; • changes mandated legislation, regulatory authorities, litigation, some which may have disproportionate effect ; • acquisitions consolidation within our industry, which may result more formidable competitors; • our ability attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and product managers; • our ability cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and • our reputation and brand strength relative those our competitors. are not able compete effectively, our user base and level user engagement may decrease, may become less attractive developers and marketers, and our revenue and results operations may materially and adversely affected. Actions governments that restrict access Facebook our other products their countries, that otherwise impair our ability sell advertising their countries, could substantially harm our business and financial results. Governments from time time seek censor content available Facebook our other products their country, restrict access our products from their country entirely, impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility our products their country for extended period time indefinitely. For example, user access Facebook and certain our other products has been currently restricted whole part China, Iran, and North Korea. addition, government authorities other countries may seek restrict user access our products they consider violation their laws threat public safety for other reasons, and certain our products have been restricted governments other countries from time time. possible that government authorities could take action that impairs our ability sell advertising, including countries where access our consumer-facing products may blocked restricted. For example, generate meaningful revenue from limited number resellers representing advertisers based China, and possible that the Chinese government could take action that reduces eliminates our China-based advertising revenue, whether result the trade dispute with the United States, response content issues, otherwise, take other action against , such imposing taxes other penalties, which could adversely affect our financial results. the event that content shown Facebook our other products subject censorship, access our products restricted, whole part, one more countries, other restrictions are imposed our products, our competitors are able successfully penetrate new geographic markets capture greater share existing geographic markets that cannot access where face other restrictions, our ability retain increase our user base, user engagement, the level advertising marketers may adversely affected, may not able maintain grow our revenue anticipated, and our financial results could adversely affected. Our new products and changes existing products could fail attract retain users generate revenue and profits. Our ability retain, increase, and engage our user base and increase our revenue depends heavily our ability continue evolve our existing products and create successful new products, both independently and conjunction with developers other third parties. may introduce significant changes our existing products acquire introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which have little prior development operating experience. For example, not have significant experience with consumer hardware products virtual augmented reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability successfully develop and market these products and technologies. continue incur substantial costs, and may not successful generating profits, connection with these efforts. addition, the introduction new products, changes existing products, may result new enhanced governmental regulatory scrutiny other complications that could adversely affect our business and financial results. have also invested, and expect continue invest, significant resources growing our WhatsApp and Messenger products support increasing usage such products. have historically monetized messaging only limited fashion, and may not successful our efforts generate meaningful revenue profits from messaging over the long term. addition, have announced plans implement end- -end encryption across our messaging services, well facilitate interoperability between these platforms, which plans have drawn governmental and regulatory scrutiny multiple jurisdictions. our new enhanced products fail engage users, marketers, developers, our business plans are unsuccessful, may fail attract retain users generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, other value justify our investments, and our business may adversely affected. make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results and may not produce the long-term benefits that expect. frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, have recently implemented, and will continue implement, changes our user data practices. Some these changes reduce our ability effectively target ads, which has some extent adversely affected, and will continue adversely affect, our advertising business. For example, our Off-Facebook Activity tool enables users place limits our storage and use information about their interactions with advertisers\' apps and websites, which will reduce our ability deliver the most relevant and effective ads our users. Similarly, from time time update our News Feed ranking algorithm optimize the user experience, and these changes have had, and may the future have, the effect reducing time spent and some measures user engagement with Facebook, which could adversely affect our financial results. From time time, may also change the size, frequency, relative prominence ads order improve quality and overall user experience. addition, have made, and expect continue make, other changes our products which may adversely affect the distribution content publishers, marketers, and developers, and could reduce their incentive invest their efforts Facebook. also may introduce new features other changes existing products, introduce new stand-alone products, that attract users away from properties, formats, use cases where have more proven means monetization. For example, plan continue promote the Stories format, which becoming increasingly popular for sharing content across our products, but our advertising efforts with this format are still under development and not currently monetize Stories the same rate News Feed. addition, focus growing users and engagement across our family products, from time time these efforts have reduced, and may the future reduce, engagement with one more products and services favor other products services that monetize less successfully that are not growing quickly. These decisions may adversely affect our business and results operations and may not produce the long-term benefits that expect. are not able maintain and enhance our brands, our ability expand our base users, marketers, and developers may impaired, and our business and financial results may harmed. believe that our brands have significantly contributed the success our business. also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands critical expanding our base users, marketers, and developers. Many our new users are referred existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely our ability continue provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which may not successfully. may introduce new products terms service policies that users not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions our developers advertisers may affect our brands users not have positive experience using third-party mobile and web applications integrated with our products interacting with parties that advertise through our products. will also continue experience media, legislative, regulatory scrutiny our actions decisions regarding user privacy, encryption, content, advertising, and other issues, including actions decisions connection with elections, which may adversely affect our reputation and brands. For example, March , announced developments regarding the misuse certain data developer that shared such data with third parties violation our terms and policies. also may fail respond expeditiously appropriately the sharing objectionable content our services objectionable practices advertisers developers, otherwise address user concerns, which has occurred the past and which could erode confidence our brands. Our brands may also negatively affected the actions users that are deemed hostile inappropriate other users, the actions users acting under false inauthentic identities, the use our products services disseminate information that deemed misleading ( intended manipulate opinions), perceived actual efforts governments obtain access user information for security-related purposes censor certain content our platform, the use our products services for illicit objectionable ends, including, for example, any such actions around the . presidential election other elections around the world. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will require make substantial investments and these investments may not successful. Certain our past actions, such the foregoing matter regarding developer misuse data, have eroded confidence our brands, and fail successfully promote and maintain our brands incur excessive expenses this effort, our business and financial results may adversely affected. Security breaches, improper access disclosure our data user data, other hacking and phishing attacks our systems, other cyber incidents could harm our reputation and adversely affect our business. Our industry prone cyber-attacks third parties seeking unauthorized access our data users\' data disrupt our ability provide service. Our products and services involve the collection, storage, processing, and transmission large amount data. Any failure prevent mitigate security breaches and improper access disclosure our data user data, including personal information, content, payment information from users, information from marketers, could result the loss, modification, disclosure, destruction, other misuse such data, which could harm our business and reputation and diminish our competitive position. addition, computer malware, viruses, social engineering (predominantly spear phishing attacks), and general hacking have become more prevalent our industry, have occurred our systems the past, and will occur our systems the future. also regularly encounter attempts create false undesirable user accounts, purchase ads, take other actions our platform for purposes such spamming, spreading misinformation, other objectionable ends. result our prominence, the size our user base, the types and volume personal data our systems, and the evolving nature our products and services (including our efforts involving new and emerging technologies), believe that are particularly attractive target for such breaches and attacks, including from highly sophisticated, state-sponsored, otherwise well-funded actors. Our efforts address undesirable activity our platform also increase the risk retaliatory attacks. Such breaches and attacks may cause interruptions the services provide, degrade the user experience, cause users marketers lose confidence and trust our products, impair our internal systems, result financial harm . Our efforts protect our company data the information receive, and disable undesirable activities our platform, may also unsuccessful due software bugs other technical malfunctions; employee, contractor, vendor error malfeasance, including defects vulnerabilities our vendors\' information technology systems offerings; government surveillance; breaches physical security our facilities technical infrastructure; other threats that evolve. addition, third parties may attempt fraudulently induce employees users disclose information order gain access our data our users\' data. Cyber-attacks continue evolve sophistication and volume, and inherently may difficult detect for long periods time. Although have developed systems and processes that are designed protect our data and user data, prevent data loss, disable undesirable accounts and activities our platform, and prevent detect security breaches, cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security, that will able react timely manner, that our remediation efforts will successful. experience cyber-attacks and other security incidents varying degrees from time time, and may incur significant costs protecting against remediating such incidents. addition, some our developers other partners, such those that help measure the effectiveness ads, may receive store information provided our users through mobile web applications integrated with Facebook. provide limited information such third parties based the scope services provided . However, these third parties developers fail adopt adhere adequate data security practices, the event breach their networks, our data our users\' data may improperly accessed, used, disclosed. are subject variety laws and regulations the United States and abroad relating cybersecurity and data protection, well obligations under the modified consent order entered into July with the . Federal Trade Commission (FTC), which pending federal court approval. result, affected users government authorities could initiate legal regulatory actions against connection with any actual perceived security breaches improper access disclosure data, which has occurred the past and which could cause incur significant expense and liability result orders consent decrees forcing modify our business practices. Such incidents our efforts remediate such incidents may also result decline our active user base engagement levels. Any these events could have material and adverse effect our business, reputation, financial results. For example, September , announced our discovery third-party cyber-attack that exploited vulnerability Facebook\' code steal user access tokens, which were then used access certain profile information from approximately million user accounts Facebook. While took steps remediate the attack, including fixing the vulnerability, resetting user access tokens and notifying affected users, may discover and announce additional developments, which could further erode confidence our brand. addition, the events surrounding this cyber-attack became the subject Irish Data Protection Commission and other government inquiries. Any such inquiries could subject substantial fines and costs, require change our business practices, divert resources and the attention management from our business, adversely affect our business. anticipate that our ongoing efforts related privacy, safety, security, and content review will identify additional instances misuse user data other undesirable activity third parties our platform. addition our efforts mitigate cybersecurity risks, are making significant investments privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts combat misuse our services and user data third parties, including investigations and audits platform applications that previously accessed information large number users our services. result these efforts have discovered and announced, and anticipate that will continue discover and announce, additional incidents misuse user data other undesirable activity third parties. may not discover all such incidents activity, whether result our data limitations, including our lack visibility over our encrypted services, the scale activity our platform, other factors, and may notified such incidents activity the independent privacy assessor required under our consent order with the FTC, the media, other third parties. Such incidents and activities have the past, and may the future, include the use user data our systems manner inconsistent with our terms, contracts policies, the existence false undesirable user accounts, election interference, improper purchases, activities that threaten people\' safety - offline, instances spamming, scraping, spreading misinformation. may also unsuccessful our efforts enforce our policies otherwise remediate any such incidents. Any the foregoing developments may negatively affect user trust and engagement, harm our reputation and brands, require change our business practices manner adverse our business, and adversely affect our business and financial results. Any such developments may also subject additional litigation and regulatory inquiries, which could subject monetary penalties and damages, divert management\' time and attention, and lead enhanced regulatory oversight. Unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business. receive high degree media coverage around the world. Unfavorable publicity regarding, for example, our privacy practices, terms service, advertising policies, product changes, product quality, litigation regulatory activity, government surveillance, the actions our advertisers, the actions our developers whose products are integrated with our products, the use our products services for illicit objectionable ends, the substance enforcement our community standards, the actions our users, the quality and integrity content shared our platform, the actions other companies that provide similar services ours, has the past, and could the future, adversely affect our reputation. For example, beginning March , were the subject intense media coverage involving the misuse certain data developer that shared such data with third parties violation our terms and policies, and have continued receive negative publicity. addition, may subject negative publicity are not successful our efforts prevent the illicit objectionable use our products services connection with the . presidential election other elections around the world. Any such negative publicity could have adverse effect the size, engagement, and loyalty our user base and result decreased revenue, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our financial results will fluctuate from quarter quarter and are difficult predict. Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated the past and will fluctuate the future. Additionally, have limited operating history with the current scale our business, which makes difficult forecast our future results. result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results indicators future performance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered companies rapidly evolving markets. Our financial results any given quarter can influenced numerous factors, many which are unable predict are outside our control, including: • our ability maintain and grow our user base and user engagement; • our ability attract and retain marketers particular period; • fluctuations spending our marketers due seasonality, such historically strong spending the fourth quarter each year, episodic regional global events, other factors; • the frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality ads shown users; • the success technologies designed block the display ads; • changes third-party policies that limit our ability deliver, target, measure the effectiveness advertising; • the pricing our ads and other products; • the diversification and growth revenue sources beyond advertising Facebook and Instagram; • our ability generate revenue from Payments, the sale our consumer hardware products other products may introduce the future; • changes existing products services the development and introduction new products services our competitors; • user behavior product changes that may reduce traffic features products that successfully monetize; • increases marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that will incur grow and expand our operations and remain competitive, including costs related our data centers and technical infrastructure; • costs related our privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; • costs and expenses related the development and delivery our consumer hardware products; • our ability maintain gross margins and operating margins; • costs related acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments develop the acquired technologies; • charges associated with impairment any assets our balance sheet; • our ability obtain equipment, components, and labor for our data centers and other technical infrastructure timely and cost-effective manner; • system failures outages government blocking, which could prevent from serving ads for any period time; • breaches security privacy, and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation; • changes the manner which distribute our products inaccessibility our products due third-party actions; • fees paid third parties for content the distribution our products; • refunds other concessions provided advertisers; • share-based compensation expense, including acquisition-related expense; • adverse litigation judgments, settlements, other litigation-related costs; • changes the legislative regulatory environment, including with respect privacy and data protection, actions governments regulators, including fines, orders, consent decrees; • the overall tax rate for our business, which may affected the mix income earn the . and jurisdictions with comparatively lower tax rates, the effects share-based compensation, the effects integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, and the effects changes our business; • the impact changes tax laws judicial regulatory interpretations tax laws, which are recorded the period such laws are enacted interpretations are issued, and may significantly affect the effective tax rate that period; • tax obligations that may arise from resolutions tax examinations, including the examination are currently under the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), that materially differ from the amounts have anticipated; • fluctuations currency exchange rates and changes the proportion our revenue and expenses denominated foreign currencies; • trading activity our share repurchase program; • fluctuations the market values our portfolio investments and interest rates; • changes . generally accepted accounting principles; and • changes global business macroeconomic conditions. expect our rates growth decline the future. expect that our user growth rate will generally decline over time the size our active user base increases, and possible that the size our active user base may fluctuate decline one more markets, particularly achieve greater market penetration. expect our revenue growth rate will continue decline over time our revenue increases higher levels. our growth rates decline, investors\' perceptions our business may adversely affected and the trading price our Class common stock could decline. Our costs are continuing grow, and some our investments have the effect reducing our operating margin and profitability. our investments are not successful, our business and financial performance could harmed. Operating our business costly, and expect our expenses continue increase the future broaden our user base, users increase the amount and types content they consume and the data they share with , for example with respect video, develop and implement new products, market new and existing products and promote our brands, continue expand our technical infrastructure, continue invest new and unproven technologies, and continue hire additional employees and contractors support our expanding operations, including our efforts focus privacy, safety, security, and content review. addition, from time time are subject settlements, judgments, fines, other monetary penalties connection with legal and regulatory developments that may material our business. are also continuing increase our investments new platforms and technologies. Some these investments, particularly our significant investments virtual and augmented reality, have generated only limited revenue and reduced our operating margin and profitability. our investments are not successful, our ability grow revenue will harmed, which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. Given our levels share-based compensation, our tax rate may vary significantly depending our stock price. The tax effects the accounting for share-based compensation may significantly impact our effective tax rate from period period. periods which our stock price higher than the grant price the share-based compensation vesting that period, will recognize excess tax benefits that will decrease our effective tax rate. For example, , excess tax benefits recognized from share-based compensation decreased our provision for income taxes $ million and our effective tax rate one percentage point compared the tax rate without such benefits. future periods which our stock price lower than the grant price the share-based compensation vesting that period, our effective tax rate may increase. The amount and value share-based compensation issued relative our earnings particular period will also affect the magnitude the impact share-based compensation our effective tax rate. These tax effects are dependent our stock price, which not control, and decline our stock price could significantly increase our effective tax rate and adversely affect our financial results. Our business subject complex and evolving . and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, content, competition, consumer protection, and other matters. Many these laws and regulations are subject change and uncertain interpretation, and could result claims, changes our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost operations, declines user growth engagement, otherwise harm our business. are subject variety laws and regulations the United States and abroad that involve matters central our business, including privacy, data protection and personal information, rights publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic other trade prohibitions sanctions, anti-corruption law compliance, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction new products, expansion our activities certain jurisdictions, other actions that may take may subject additional laws, regulations, other government scrutiny. addition, foreign data protection, privacy, content, competition, and other laws and regulations can impose different obligations more restrictive than those the United States. These . federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which some cases can enforced private parties addition government entities, are constantly evolving and can subject significant change. result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly the new and rapidly evolving industry which operate, and may interpreted and applied inconsistently from country country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices. For example, regulatory legislative actions affecting the manner which display content our users obtain consent various practices could adversely affect user growth and engagement. Such actions could affect the manner which provide our services adversely affect our financial results. are also subject laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances can transfer, process and receive certain data that critical our operations, including data shared between countries regions which operate and data shared among our products and services. For example, , the European Union and United States agreed transfer framework for data transferred from the European Union the United States, called the Privacy Shield, but this framework subject annual review that could result changes our obligations and also subject challenge regulators and private parties, including pending legal challenge private party. addition, the other bases upon which Facebook relies legitimize the transfer such data, such Standard Contractual Clauses (SCCs), have been subjected regulatory and judicial scrutiny. For example, the Irish Data Protection Commissioner has challenged the legal grounds for transfers user data Facebook, Inc., and the Irish High Court has referred this challenge the Court Justice the European Union for decision. have also been managing investigations and lawsuits Europe, India, and other jurisdictions regarding the August update WhatsApp\' terms service and privacy policy and its sharing certain data with other Facebook products and services, including lawsuit currently pending before the Supreme Court India. one more the legal bases for transferring data from Europe the United States invalidated the transfer frameworks are amended, are unable transfer data between and among countries and regions which operate, are restricted from sharing data among our products and services, could affect the manner which provide our services our ability target ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. Proposed new legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. For example, the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) took effect May and applies all our products and services used people Europe. The GDPR includes operational requirements for companies that receive process personal data residents the European Union that are different from those previously place the European Union. result, implemented measures change our service for minors under the age for certain countries Europe that maintain the minimum age under the GDPR. also obtain consent and offer new controls existing and new users Europe before processing data for certain aspects our service. addition, the GDPR requires submission personal data breach notifications our designated European privacy regulator, the Irish Data Protection Commission, and includes significant penalties for non-compliance with the notification obligation well other requirements the regulation. The Brazilian General Data Protection Law will impose requirements similar GDPR products and services offered users Brazil, effective August . The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), which took effect January , also establishes certain transparency rules and creates new data privacy rights for users, including more ability control how their data shared with third parties. These laws and regulations are evolving and subject interpretation, and resulting limitations our advertising services, reductions advertising marketers, have some extent adversely affected, and will continue adversely affect, our advertising business. Similarly, there are number legislative proposals the European Union, the United States, both the federal and state level, well other jurisdictions that could impose new obligations limitations areas affecting our business. addition, some countries are considering have passed legislation implementing data protection requirements requiring local storage and processing data similar requirements that could increase the cost and complexity delivering our services. These laws and regulations, well any associated claims, inquiries, investigations any other government actions, have the past led , and may the future lead , unfavorable outcomes including increased compliance costs, delays impediments the development new products, negative publicity and reputational harm, increased operating costs, diversion management time and attention, and remedies that harm our business, including fines demands orders that modify cease existing business practices. have been subject regulatory and other government investigations, enforcement actions, and settlements, and expect continue subject such proceedings and other inquiries the future, which could cause incur substantial costs require change our business practices manner materially adverse our business. From time time, receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations, many which are evolving and subject interpretation. are and expect continue the subject investigations, inquiries, data requests, requests for information, actions, and audits the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly the areas privacy, data protection, law enforcement, consumer protection, and competition, continue grow and expand our operations. addition, are currently, and may the future , subject regulatory orders consent decrees. For example, data protection, competition, and consumer protection authorities the European Union have initiated actions, investigations, administrative orders seeking restrict the ways which collect and use information, impose sanctions, and other authorities may the same. addition, beginning March , became subject FTC, state attorneys general, and other government inquiries the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions connection with our platform and user data practices well the misuse certain data developer that shared such data with third parties violation our terms and policies. July , entered into settlement and modified consent order resolve the FTC inquiry, which pending federal court approval. Among other matters, our settlement with the FTC requires pay penalty $ billion and significantly enhance our practices and processes for privacy compliance and oversight. Beginning September , also became subject Irish Data Protection Commission (IDPC) and other government inquiries connection with third-party cyber-attack that exploited vulnerability Facebook\' code steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts Facebook. From time time also notify the IDPC, our designated European privacy regulator under the GDPR, certain other personal data breaches and privacy issues, and are subject inquiries and investigations regarding various aspects our regulatory compliance. addition, competition authorities the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions have initiated formal and informal inquiries and investigations into many aspects our business, including with respect users and advertisers, well our industry. For example, June were informed the FTC that had opened antitrust investigation our company. addition, beginning the third quarter , became the subject antitrust inquiries and investigations the . Department Justice, the . House Representatives, and state attorneys general. These inquiries and investigations concern, among other things, our business practices the areas social networking social media services, digital advertising, and mobile online applications, well past acquisitions. Orders issued , inquiries enforcement actions initiated , government regulatory authorities could cause incur substantial costs, expose unanticipated civil and criminal liability penalties (including substantial monetary remedies), interrupt require change our business practices manner materially adverse our business, result negative publicity and reputational harm, divert resources and the attention management from our business, subject other remedies that adversely affect our business. Compliance with our FTC consent order, the GDPR, the CCPA, and other regulatory and legislative privacy requirements will require significant operational resources and modifications our business practices, and any compliance failures may have material adverse effect our business, reputation, and financial results. are engaged ongoing privacy compliance and oversight efforts, including result the modified consent order entered into July with the FTC, well our efforts comply with the GDPR and other regulatory and legislative requirements around the world, including the CCPA. particular, have agreed with the FTC implement comprehensive expansion our privacy program, including substantial management and board directors oversight, stringent operational requirements and reporting obligations, and process regularly certify our compliance with the privacy program the FTC, which will challenging and costly implement. expect that these enhancements will result both improved privacy compliance and oversight and the discovery additional privacy issues, least the near-term, and expect continue notify the FTC such issues from time time accordance with our reporting obligations under the consent order. These compliance and oversight efforts will increase demand our systems and resources, and will require significant investments, including investments compliance processes, personnel, and technical infrastructure. the near-term, are reallocating resources internally assist with these efforts, and this has had, and will continue have, adverse impact our other business initiatives. addition, these efforts will require substantial modifications our business practices and make some practices such product and ads development more difficult, time-consuming, and costly. result, believe our ability develop and launch new features, products, and services timely manner will adversely affected. also expect that our privacy compliance and oversight efforts will require significant time and attention from our management and board directors. addition, regulatory and legislative privacy requirements are constantly evolving and can subject significant change and uncertain interpretation. are unable successfully implement and comply with the mandates the FTC consent order, GDPR, CCPA, other regulatory legislative requirements, are found violation the consent order other requirements, may subject regulatory governmental investigations lawsuits, which may result significant monetary fines, judgments, other penalties, and may also required make additional changes our business practices. Any these events could have material adverse effect our business, reputation, and financial results. are unable protect our intellectual property, the value our brands and other intangible assets may diminished, and our business may adversely affected. rely and expect continue rely combination confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom have relationships, well trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, protect our proprietary rights. the United States and internationally, have filed various applications for protection certain aspects our intellectual property, and currently hold significant number registered trademarks and issued patents multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. Third parties may knowingly unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held , and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not approved. addition, effective intellectual property protection may not available every country which operate intend operate our business. any all these cases, may required expend significant time and expense order prevent infringement enforce our rights. Although have generally taken measures protect our proprietary rights, there can assurance that others will not offer products concepts that are substantially similar ours and compete with our business. addition, regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology developed available under other open licenses, and include open source software our products. For example, have contributed certain specifications and designs related our data center equipment the Open Compute Project Foundation, non-profit entity that shares and develops such information with the technology community, under the Open Web Foundation License. result our open source contributions and the use open source our products, may license required license disclose code and innovations that turn out material our business and may also exposed increased litigation risk. the protection our proprietary rights inadequate prevent unauthorized use appropriation third parties, the value our brands and other intangible assets may diminished and competitors may able more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods operations. Any these events could have adverse effect our business and financial results. are currently, and expect the future, party patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming and, resolved adversely, could have significant impact our business, financial condition, results operations. Companies the Internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based allegations infringement, misappropriation, other violations intellectual property other rights. addition, various "non-practicing entities" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt aggressively assert their rights order extract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time time may introduce acquire new products, including areas where historically have not competed, which could increase our exposure patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities. From time time, receive notice from patent holders and other parties alleging that certain our products and services, user content, infringe their intellectual property rights. presently are involved number intellectual property lawsuits, and face increasing competition and gain increasingly high profile, expect the number patent and other intellectual property claims against grow. Defending patent and other intellectual property litigation costly and can impose significant burden management and employees, and there can assurances that favorable final outcomes will obtained all cases. addition, plaintiffs may seek, and may become subject , preliminary provisional rulings the course any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring cease some all our operations. may decide settle such lawsuits and disputes terms that are unfavorable . Similarly, any litigation which are party resolved adversely, may subject unfavorable judgment that may not reversed upon appeal. The terms such settlement judgment may require cease some all our operations pay substantial amounts the other party. addition, may have seek license continue practices found violation third party\' rights, which may not available reasonable terms, all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. result, may also required develop alternative non-infringing technology practices discontinue the practices. The development alternative non-infringing technology practices could require significant effort and expense, could result less effective technology practices otherwise negatively affect the user experience, may not feasible. have experienced unfavorable outcomes such disputes and litigation the past, and our business, financial condition, and results operations could adversely affected result unfavorable resolution the disputes and litigation referred above. are involved numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, and, resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, results operations. addition intellectual property claims, are also involved numerous other lawsuits, including putative class action lawsuits, many which claim statutory damages and seek significant changes our business operations, and anticipate that will continue target for numerous lawsuits the future. Because the scale our user base, the plaintiffs class action cases filed against typically claim enormous monetary damages even the alleged per-user harm small non-existent. addition, have the past, and may the future, subject additional class action lawsuits based advertiser claims, antitrust claims, employment claims, product performance other claims related the use consumer hardware and software, well virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. For example, are currently the subject multiple putative class action suits connection with our platform and user data practices and the misuse certain data developer that shared such data with third parties violation our terms and policies, well the disclosure our earnings results for the second quarter . also recently agreed settlements principle resolve certain lawsuits connection with the "tag suggestions" facial recognition feature Facebook and third-party cyber-attack that exploited vulnerability Facebook\' code steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts Facebook. believe the remaining lawsuits are without merit and are vigorously defending them. However, the results such lawsuits and claims cannot predicted with certainty, and any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result payments substantial monetary damages fines, undesirable changes our products business practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, results operations could materially and adversely affected. There can assurances that favorable final outcome will obtained all our cases, and defending any lawsuit costly and can impose significant burden management and employees. Any litigation which are party may result onerous unfavorable judgment that may not reversed upon appeal payments substantial monetary damages fines, may decide settle lawsuits similarly unfavorable terms, which has occurred the past and which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results operations. may incur liability result information retrieved from transmitted over the Internet published using our products result claims related our products, and legislation regulating content our platform may require change our products business practices. have faced, currently face, and will continue face claims relating information that published made available our products. particular, the nature our business exposes claims related defamation, dissemination misinformation news hoaxes, discrimination, intellectual property rights, rights publicity and privacy, personal injury torts, laws regulating hate speech other types content. This risk enhanced certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may unclear where may less protected under local laws than are the United States. For example, April , the European Union passed directive expanding online platform liability for copyright infringement and regulating certain uses news content online, which member states must implement June . addition, there have been various Congressional efforts restrict the scope the protections available online platforms under Section the Communications Decency Act, and our current protections from liability for third-party content the United States could decrease change. could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, are found liable, significant damages. could also face fines orders restricting blocking our services particular geographies result content hosted our services. For example, legislation Germany has the past, and may the future, result the imposition fines for failure comply with certain content removal, law enforcement cooperation, and disclosure obligations. Other countries, including Australia, France, Singapore, and the United Kingdom, are considering have implemented similar legislation imposing penalties for failure remove content follow certain processes. Such legislation also has the past, and may the future, require change our products business practices, increase our compliance costs, otherwise impact our operations our ability provide services certain geographies. For example, the European Copyright Directive requires certain online services obtain authorizations for copyrighted content implement measures prevent the availability that content, which may require make substantial investments compliance processes. any the foregoing events occur, our business and financial results could adversely affected. Our CEO has control over key decision making result his control majority the voting power our outstanding capital stock. Mark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, able exercise voting rights with respect majority the voting power our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability control the outcome matters submitted our stockholders for approval, including the election directors and any merger, consolidation, sale all substantially all our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, prevent change control, merger, consolidation, sale all substantially all our assets that our other stockholders support, conversely this concentrated control could result the consummation such transaction that our other stockholders not support. This concentrated control could also discourage potential investor from acquiring our Class common stock, which has limited voting power relative the Class common stock, and might harm the trading price our Class common stock. addition, . Zuckerberg has the ability control the management and major strategic investments our company result his position our CEO and his ability control the election replacement our directors. the event his death, the shares our capital stock that . Zuckerberg owns will transferred the persons entities that has designated. board member and officer, . Zuckerberg owes fiduciary duty our stockholders and must act good faith manner reasonably believes the best interests our stockholders. stockholder, even controlling stockholder, . Zuckerberg entitled vote his shares, and shares over which has voting control governed voting agreement, his own interests, which may not always the interests our stockholders generally. plan continue make acquisitions, which could harm our financial condition results operations and may adversely affect the price our common stock. part our business strategy, have made and intend continue make acquisitions add specialized employees and complementary companies, products, technologies. may not able find suitable acquisition candidates, and may not able complete acquisitions favorable terms, all. some cases, the costs such acquisitions may substantial, and there assurance that will receive favorable return investment for our acquisitions. may pay substantial amounts cash incur debt pay for acquisitions, which could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence indebtedness would also result increased fixed obligations and increased interest expense, and could also include covenants other restrictions that would impede our ability manage our operations. may also issue equity securities pay for acquisitions and regularly grant RSUs retain the employees acquired companies, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and result dilution our stockholders. addition, any acquisitions announce could viewed negatively users, marketers, developers, investors, which may adversely affect our business the price our Class common stock. may also discover liabilities deficiencies associated with the companies assets acquire that were not identified advance, which may result significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness our due diligence review and our ability evaluate the results such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness statements and disclosures made actions taken the companies acquire their representatives, well the limited amount time which acquisitions are executed. addition, may fail accurately forecast the financial impact acquisition transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions may also result our recording significant additional expenses our results operations and recording substantial finite-lived intangible assets our balance sheet upon closing. Any these factors may adversely affect our financial condition results operations. may not able successfully integrate our acquisitions, and may incur significant costs integrate and support the companies acquire. The integration acquisitions requires significant time and resources, and may not manage these processes successfully. Our ability successfully integrate complex acquisitions unproven, particularly with respect companies that have significant operations that develop products where not have prior experience. For example, the technology and products acquired from Oculus were relatively new Facebook the time the acquisition, and did not have significant experience with, structure place support, such technology and products prior the acquisition. continue make substantial investments resources support our acquisitions, which will result significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas our business. cannot assure you that these investments will successful. fail successfully integrate the companies acquire, may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may harmed. our goodwill finite-lived intangible assets become impaired, may required record significant charge earnings. review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events changes circumstances indicate the carrying value may not recoverable, such decline stock price and market capitalization. test goodwill for impairment least annually. such goodwill finite-lived intangible assets are deemed impaired, impairment loss equal the amount which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value the assets would recognized. may required record significant charge our financial statements during the period which any impairment our goodwill finite-lived intangible assets determined, which would negatively affect our results operations. Our business dependent our ability maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption our service could damage our reputation, result potential loss users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results. Our reputation and ability attract, retain, and serve our users dependent upon the reliable performance our products and our underlying technical infrastructure. have the past experienced, and may the future experience, interruptions the availability performance our products from time time. Our systems may not adequately designed may not operate with the reliability and redundancy necessary avoid performance delays outages that could harmful our business. our products are unavailable when users attempt access them, they not load quickly expected, users may not use our products often the future, all, and our ability serve ads may disrupted, any which could adversely affect our business and financial performance. the amount and types information shared Facebook and our other products continue grow and evolve, the usage patterns our global community continue evolve, and our internal operational demands continue grow, will need increasing amount technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, continue satisfy our needs. possible that may fail continue effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure accommodate these increased demands, which may adversely affect our user engagement and advertising revenue growth. addition, our business may subject interruptions, delays, failures resulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, geopolitical conflict, other physical security threats, cyber-attacks, other catastrophic events. such event were occur, users may subject service disruptions outages and may not able recover our technical infrastructure and user data timely manner restart provide our services, which may adversely affect our financial results. substantial portion our network infrastructure provided third parties. Any disruption failure the services receive from these providers could harm our ability handle existing increased traffic and could significantly harm our business. Any financial other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business, and exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability problems with the services they provide. could experience unforeseen difficulties building and operating key portions our technical infrastructure. have designed and built our own data centers and key portions our technical infrastructure through which serve our products, and plan continue significantly expand the size our infrastructure primarily through data centers and other projects. The infrastructure expansion are undertaking complex and involves projects multiple locations. Unanticipated delays the completion these projects, including due any shortage labor necessary building portions such projects, availability components, challenges obtaining required government regulatory approvals, other geopolitical challenges actions governments, may lead increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions the delivery degradation the quality our products. addition, there may issues related this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases design and implementation, which may only become evident after have started fully utilize the underlying equipment, that could further degrade the user experience increase our costs. Any these events could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial results. Our products and internal systems rely software and hardware that highly technical, and these systems contain errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, are unsuccessful addressing mitigating technical limitations our systems, our business could adversely affected. Our products and internal systems rely software and hardware, including software and hardware developed maintained internally and third parties, that highly technical and complex. addition, our products and internal systems depend the ability such software and hardware store, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts data. The software and hardware which rely has contained, and will the future contain, errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, and our systems are subject certain technical limitations that may compromise our ability meet our objectives. Some errors, bugs, vulnerabilities inherently may difficult detect and may only discovered after the code has been released for external internal use. For example, September , announced our discovery third-party cyber-attack that exploited vulnerability Facebook\' code steal user access tokens and access certain profile information from user accounts Facebook. Errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, design defects, technical limitations within the software and hardware which rely have the past led , and may the future lead , outcomes including negative experience for users and marketers who use our products, compromised ability our products perform manner consistent with our terms, contracts, policies, delayed product introductions enhancements, targeting, measurement, billing errors, compromised ability protect the data our users and our intellectual property, reductions our ability provide some all our services. For example, make commitments our users how their data will used within and across our products, and our systems are subject errors, bugs and technical limitations that may prevent from fulfilling these commitments reliably. our systems contain bugs errors not properly address mitigate the technical limitations our systems, may fail fulfill our commitments our users and subject regulatory scrutiny litigation that could harm our business and result fines, damages, other remedies. addition, errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, defects the software and hardware which rely, and any associated degradations interruptions service, have the past led , and may the future lead , outcomes including damage our reputation, loss users, loss marketers, loss revenue, regulatory inquiries, liability for damages, any which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Technologies have been developed that can block the display our ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. Technologies have been developed, and will likely continue developed, that can block the display our ads block our measurement tools, particularly for advertising displayed personal computers. generate substantially all our revenue from advertising, including revenue resulting from the display ads personal computers. Revenue generated from the display ads personal computers has been impacted these technologies from time time. result, these technologies have had adverse effect our financial results and, such technologies continue proliferate, particular with respect mobile platforms, our future financial results may harmed. Real perceived inaccuracies our community and other metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. The numbers for our key metrics, which include our Facebook metrics (DAUs, MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU)) and Family metrics (DAP, MAP, and average revenue per person (ARPP)), are calculated using internal company data based the activity user accounts. While these numbers are based what believe reasonable estimates our user base for the applicable period measurement, there are inherent challenges measuring usage our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. The methodologies used measure these metrics require significant judgment and are also susceptible algorithm other technical errors. addition, are continually seeking improve our estimates our user base, and such estimates may change due improvements changes our methodology. regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time time discover inaccuracies our metrics make adjustments improve their accuracy, which can result adjustments our historical metrics. Our ability recalculate our historical metrics may impacted data limitations other factors that require apply different methodologies for such adjustments. generally not intend update previously disclosed Family metrics for any such inaccuracies adjustments that are within the error margins disclosed below. addition, our Facebook metrics and Family metrics estimates will differ from estimates published third parties due differences methodology. regularly evaluate our Facebook metrics estimate the number "duplicate" and "false" accounts among our MAUs. duplicate account one that user maintains addition his her principal account. divide "false" accounts into two categories: ( ) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles for business, organization, non-human entity such pet (such entities are permitted Facebook using Page rather than personal profile under our terms service); and ( ) violating accounts, which represent user profiles that believe are intended used for purposes that violate our terms service, such bots and spam. The estimates duplicate and false accounts are based internal review limited sample accounts, and apply significant judgment making this determination. For example, identify duplicate accounts use data signals such identical addresses and similar user names, and identify false accounts look for names that appear fake other behavior that appears inauthentic the reviewers. Any loss access data signals use this process, whether result our own product decisions, actions third-party browser mobile platforms, regulatory legislative requirements, other factors, also may impact the stability accuracy our estimates duplicate and false accounts. Our estimates also may change our methodologies evolve, including through the application new data signals technologies product changes that may allow identify previously undetected duplicate false accounts and may improve our ability evaluate broader population our users. Duplicate and false accounts are very difficult measure our scale, and possible that the actual number duplicate and false accounts may vary significantly from our estimates. the fourth quarter , estimated that duplicate accounts may have represented approximately % our worldwide MAUs. believe the percentage duplicate accounts meaningfully higher developing markets such the Philippines and Vietnam, compared more developed markets. the fourth quarter , estimated that false accounts may have represented approximately % our worldwide MAUs. Our estimation false accounts can vary result episodic spikes the creation such accounts, which have seen originate more frequently specific countries such Indonesia and Vietnam. From time time, disable certain user accounts, make product changes, take other actions reduce the number duplicate false accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAU and MAU estimates particular period. intend disclose our estimates the number duplicate and false accounts among our MAUs annual basis. Many people our community have user accounts more than one our products, and some people have multiple user accounts within individual product. Accordingly, for our Family metrics, not seek count the total number user accounts across our products because believe that would not reflect the actual size our community. Rather, our Family metrics represent our estimates the number unique people using least one Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. not require people use common identifier link their accounts use multiple products our Family, and therefore must seek attribute multiple user accounts within and across products individual people. calculate these metrics, rely upon complex techniques, algorithms and machine learning models that seek count the individual people behind user accounts, including matching multiple user accounts within individual product and across multiple products when believe they are attributable single person, and counting such group accounts one person. These techniques and models require significant judgment, are subject data and other limitations discussed below, and inherently are subject statistical variances and uncertainties. estimate the potential error our Family metrics primarily based user survey data, which itself subject error well. While expect the error margin for our Family metrics vary from period period, estimate that such margin generally will approximately % our worldwide MAP. our scale, very difficult attribute multiple user accounts within and across products individual people, and possible that the actual numbers unique people using our products may vary significantly from our estimates, potentially beyond our estimated error margins. result, also possible that our Family metrics may indicate changes trends user numbers that not match actual changes trends. calculate our estimates Family DAP and MAP, currently use series machine learning models that are developed based internal reviews limited samples user accounts and calibrated against user survey data. apply significant judgment designing these models and calculating these estimates. For example, match user accounts within individual products and across multiple products, use data signals such similar device information, addresses, and user names. also calibrate our models against data from periodic user surveys varying sizes and frequency across our products, which are inherently subject error. addition, our data limitations may affect our understanding certain details our business and increase the risk error for our Family metrics estimates. Our techniques and models rely variety data signals from different products, and rely more limited data signals for some products compared others. For example, result limited visibility into encrypted products, have fewer data signals from WhatsApp user accounts and primarily rely phone numbers and device information match WhatsApp user accounts with accounts our other products. Similarly, although Messenger Kids users are included our Family metrics, not seek match their accounts with accounts our other applications for purposes calculating DAP and MAP. Any loss access data signals use our process for calculating Family metrics, whether result our own product decisions, actions third-party browser mobile platforms, regulatory legislative requirements, other factors, also may impact the stability accuracy our reported Family metrics. Our estimates Family metrics also may change our methodologies evolve, including through the application new data signals technologies, product changes, other improvements our user surveys, algorithms, machine learning that may improve our ability match accounts within and across our products otherwise evaluate the broad population our users. addition, such evolution may allow identify previously undetected violating accounts ( defined below). regularly evaluate our Family metrics estimate the percentage our MAP consisting solely "violating" accounts. define "violating" accounts accounts which believe are intended used for purposes that violate our terms service, including bots and spam. the fourth quarter , estimated that approximately % our worldwide MAP consisted solely violating accounts. Such estimation based internal review limited sample accounts, and apply significant judgment making this determination. For example, look for account information and behaviors associated with Facebook and Instagram accounts that appear inauthentic the reviewers, but have limited visibility into WhatsApp user activity due encryption. addition, believe individual person has one more violating accounts, not include such person our violating accounts estimation long believe they have one account that does not constitute violating account. From time time, disable certain user accounts, make product changes, take other actions reduce the number violating accounts among our users, which may also reduce our DAP and MAP estimates particular period. intend disclose our estimates the percentage our MAP consisting solely violating accounts annual basis. Violating accounts are very difficult measure our scale, and possible that the actual number violating accounts may vary significantly from our estimates. Other data limitations also may affect our understanding certain details our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates decline usage among younger users, this age data unreliable because disproportionate number our younger users register with inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding usage age group may not complete. addition, our data regarding the geographic location our users estimated based number factors, such the user\' address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user\' actual location. For example, user may appear accessing Facebook from the location the proxy server that the user connects rather than from the user\' actual location. The methodologies used measure our metrics are also susceptible algorithm other technical errors, and our estimates for revenue user location and revenue user device are also affected these factors. addition, from time time provide, rely , certain other metrics, including those relating the reach and effectiveness our ads. All our metrics are subject software bugs, inconsistencies our systems, and human error. marketers, developers, investors not perceive our metrics accurate, discover material inaccuracies our metrics, may subject liability, our reputation may harmed, and marketers and developers may less willing allocate their budgets resources Facebook our other products, which could negatively affect our business and financial results. cannot assure you that will effectively manage our growth. Our employee headcount and the scope and complexity our business have increased significantly, with the number employees increasing , December , from , December , , and expect such headcount growth continue for the foreseeable future. addition, plan continue hire number employees and contractors order address various privacy, safety, security, and content review initiatives. The growth and expansion our business and products create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, including managing multiple relationships with users, marketers, developers, and other third parties. our operations and the number our third-party relationships continue grow, our information technology systems our internal controls and procedures may not adequate support such growth. addition, some members our management not have significant experience managing large global business operation, our management may not able manage such growth effectively. effectively manage our growth, must continue improve our operational, financial, and management processes and systems and effectively expand, train, and manage our personnel. our organization continues grow, and are required implement more complex organizational management structures, may find increasingly difficult maintain the benefits our corporate culture, including our ability quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance. The loss one more our key personnel, our failure attract and retain other highly qualified personnel the future, could harm our business. currently depend the continued services and performance our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl . Sandberg. Although have entered into employment agreements with . Zuckerberg and . Sandberg, the agreements have specific duration and constitute -will employment. addition, many our key technologies and systems are custom-made for our business our personnel. The loss key personnel, including members management well key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our operations and have adverse effect our business. continue grow, cannot guarantee will continue attract and retain the personnel need maintain our competitive position. particular, intend continue hire significant number technical personnel the foreseeable future, and expect continue face significant challenges hiring such personnel, particularly the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located, whether result competition with other companies, challenges due the high cost living, facilities and infrastructure constraints, other factors. continue mature, the incentives attract, retain, and motivate employees provided our equity awards future arrangements may not effective the past, and issue significant equity attract additional employees retain our existing employees, would incur substantial additional share-based compensation expense and the ownership our existing stockholders would further diluted. Our ability attract, retain, and motivate employees may also adversely affected stock price volatility. result these factors, may difficult for continue retain and motivate our employees. not succeed attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, retaining and motivating existing personnel, may unable grow effectively. may not able continue successfully maintain grow usage and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products. have made and are continuing make investments enable developers build, grow, and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products. Such existing and prospective developers may not successful building, growing, monetizing mobile and web applications that create and maintain user engagement. Additionally, developers may choose build other platforms, including mobile platforms controlled third parties, rather than building products that integrate with Facebook and our other products. are continuously seeking balance the distribution objectives our developers with our desire provide optimal user experience, and may not successful achieving balance that continues attract and retain such developers. For example, from time time, have taken actions reduce the volume communications from these developers users Facebook and our other products with the objective enhancing the user experience, and such actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization opportunities from, mobile and web applications integrated with our products. addition, part our efforts related privacy, safety, and security, are conducting investigations and audits large number platform applications, and also have announced several product changes that restrict developer access certain user data. some instances, these actions, well other actions enforce our policies applicable developers, have adversely affected, will adversely affect, our relationships with developers. are not successful our efforts maintain grow the number developers that choose build products that integrate with Facebook and our other products are unable continue build and maintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may adversely affected. Payment transactions may subject additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could costly and difficult comply with that could harm our business.

Depending how our Payments product evolves, may also subject other laws and regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and lending. some jurisdictions, the application interpretation these laws and regulations not clear. increase flexibility how our use Payments may evolve and mitigate regulatory uncertainty, have received certain money transmitter licenses the United States and Electronic Money ( -Money) license that allows conduct certain regulated payment activities the participating member countries the European Economic Area, which will generally require demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws these areas. Our efforts comply with these laws and regulations could costly and result diversion management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. the event that are found violation any such legal regulatory requirements, may subject monetary fines other penalties such cease and desist order, may required make product changes, any which could have adverse effect our business and financial results. addition, may subject variety additional risks result Payments transactions, including: increased costs and diversion management time and effort and other resources deal with bad transactions customer disputes; potential fraudulent otherwise illegal activity users, developers, employees, third parties; restrictions the investment consumer funds used transact Payments; and additional disclosure and reporting requirements. also intend launch certain payments functionality WhatsApp and have announced plans develop digital payments products and services, which may subject many the foregoing risks and additional licensing requirements. Our participation the Libra Association will subject significant regulatory scrutiny and other risks that could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial results. June , announced our participation the Libra Association, which will oversee proposed digital payments system powered blockchain technology, and our plans for Calibra, digital wallet for Libra which expect launch Messenger, WhatsApp, and standalone application. Libra based relatively new and unproven technology, and the laws and regulations surrounding blockchain-based payments are uncertain and evolving.

These laws and regulations, well any associated inquiries investigations, may delay impede the launch the Libra currency well the development our products and services, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, otherwise harm our business. addition, market acceptance such currency subject significant uncertainty. such, there can assurance that Libra our associated products and services will made available timely manner, all. not have significant prior experience with blockchain-based payments technology, which may adversely affect our ability successfully develop and market these products and services. will also incur increased costs connection with our participation the Libra Association and the development and marketing associated products and services, and our investments may not successful. Any these events could adversely affect our business, reputation, financial results. have significant international operations and plan continue expanding our operations abroad where have more limited operating experience, and this may subject increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results. have significant international operations and plan continue the international expansion our business operations and the translation our products. currently make Facebook available more than different languages, and have offices data centers more than different countries. may enter new international markets where have limited experience marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are generally available globally, but some all our products functionality may not available certain markets due legal and regulatory complexities. For example, Facebook and certain our other products are not generally available China. also outsource certain operational functions third-party vendors globally. fail deploy, manage, oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. addition, are subject variety risks inherent doing business internationally, including: • political, social, economic instability; • risks related legal, regulatory, and other government scrutiny applicable . companies with sales and operations foreign jurisdictions, including with respect privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade compliance, competition, consumer protection, intellectual property, and terrestrial infrastructure matters; • potential damage our brand and reputation due compliance with local laws, including potential censorship requirements provide user information local authorities; • enhanced difficulty reviewing content our platform and enforcing our community standards across different languages and countries; • fluctuations currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls; • foreign exchange controls and tax and other regulations and orders that might prevent from repatriating cash earned countries outside the United States otherwise limit our ability move cash freely, and impede our ability invest such cash efficiently; • higher levels credit risk and payment fraud; • enhanced difficulties integrating any foreign acquisitions; • burdens complying with variety foreign laws, including laws related taxation, content removal, data localization, and regulatory oversight; • reduced protection for intellectual property rights some countries; • difficulties staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations; • compliance with the .

For example, the consumer hardware products sell may have quality issues resulting from the design manufacture the products, from the software used the products. Sometimes, these issues may caused components purchase from other manufacturers suppliers. the quality our consumer hardware products does not meet our customers\' expectations such products are found defective, then our brand and financial results could adversely affected. rely third parties manufacture and manage the logistics transporting and distributing our consumer hardware products. may experience supply shortages other disruptions logistics the supply chain the future that could result shipping delays and negatively impact our operations. could negatively affected are not able engage third parties with the necessary capabilities capacity reasonable terms, those engage with fail meet their obligations (whether due financial difficulties other reasons), make adverse changes the pricing other material terms such arrangements with them. The manufacturing and sale our consumer hardware products also may negatively impacted geopolitical challenges, trade disputes, other actions governments that subject supply shortages, increased costs, supply chain disruptions. also require the suppliers and business partners our consumer hardware products comply with laws and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices and standards labor, health and safety, the environment, and business ethics, but not control them their practices and standards. any them violates laws, fails implement changes accordance with newly enacted laws, implements practices standards regarded unethical, corrupt, non-compliant, could experience supply chain disruptions, government action fines, canceled orders, damage our reputation. face inventory risk with respect our consumer hardware products. are exposed inventory risks with respect our consumer hardware products result rapid changes product cycles and pricing, unsafe defective merchandise, changes consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes consumer tastes with respect our consumer hardware products, and other factors. endeavor accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking understocking consumer hardware products may sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory components are ordered and the date sale. addition, when begin selling manufacturing new consumer hardware product, may difficult establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition certain types inventory components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not returnable. Any one these factors may adversely affect our operating results. may have exposure greater than anticipated tax liabilities. Our tax obligations, including income and non-income taxes, are based part our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner which operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property, and the valuations our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable our business, including the laws the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws new ways effort raise additional tax revenue from companies such Facebook. are subject regular review and audit . federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions have taken, including our methodologies for valuing developed technology intercompany arrangements, and any adverse outcome such review audit could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount non-income taxes imposed our business, and harm our financial position, results operations, and cash flows. For example, and , the IRS issued formal assessments relating transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries conjunction with the examination the through tax years. Although disagree with the IRS\' position and are contesting this issue, the ultimate resolution uncertain and, resolved manner unfavorable , may adversely affect our financial results. The determination our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination uncertain. Our provision for income taxes determined the manner which operate our business, and any changes such operations laws applicable such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although believe that our provision for income taxes and estimates our non-income tax liabilities are reasonable, the ultimate settlement may differ from the amounts recorded our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results the period periods for which such determination made. Our future income tax rates could volatile and difficult predict due changes jurisdictional profit split, changes the amount and recognition deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes tax laws, regulations, accounting principles. Changes tax laws tax rulings could materially affect our financial position, results operations, and cash flows. The tax regimes are subject operate under, including income and non-income taxes, are unsettled and may subject significant change. Changes tax laws tax rulings, changes interpretations existing laws, could materially affect our financial position, results operations, and cash flows. For example, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act) enacted December had significant impact our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the fourth quarter , and the issuance additional regulatory accounting guidance related the Tax Act could materially affect our tax obligations and effective tax rate the period issued. addition, three-judge panel from the Ninth Circuit Court Appeals issued decision Altera Corp. . Commissioner regarding the treatment share-based compensation expense cost sharing arrangement, which had material effect our tax obligations and effective tax rate for the second quarter . the taxpayer may appeal the decision the Supreme Court the United States, the final outcome the case uncertain and could have material effect our tax obligations and effective tax rate future quarters. addition, many countries Europe, well number other countries and organizations, have recently proposed recommended changes existing tax laws have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations many countries where business require change the manner which operate our business. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working Base Erosion and Profit Shifting Project, and issued report , interim report , and expected continue issue guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined many the countries which business. Similarly, the European Commission and several countries have issued proposals that would change various aspects the current tax framework under which are taxed. These proposals include changes the existing framework calculate income tax, well proposals change impose new types non-income taxes, including taxes based percentage revenue. For example, several countries have proposed enacted taxes applicable digital services, which includes business activities social media platforms and online marketplaces, and would likely apply our business. The European Commission has conducted investigations multiple countries focusing whether local country tax rulings tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules and concluded that certain countries, including Ireland, have provided illegal state aid certain cases. These investigations may result changes the tax treatment our foreign operations. Due the large and expanding scale our international business activities, many these types changes the taxation our activities described above could increase our worldwide effective tax rate, increase the amount non-income taxes imposed our business, and harm our financial position, results operations, and cash flows. Such changes may also apply retroactively our historical operations and result taxes greater than the amounts estimated and recorded our financial statements. cannot guarantee that our share repurchase program will fully consummated that will enhance long-term stockholder value. Share repurchases could also increase the volatility the trading price our stock and will diminish our cash reserves. Although our board directors has authorized share repurchase program that commenced and does not have expiration date, the program does not obligate repurchase any specific dollar amount acquire any specific number shares our Class common stock. cannot guarantee that the program will fully consummated that will enhance long-term stockholder value. The program could affect the trading price our stock and increase volatility, and any announcement termination this program may result decrease the trading price our stock. addition, this program will diminish our cash reserves.

Any securities litigation could subject substantial costs, divert resources and the attention management from our business, and adversely affect our business. not intend pay cash dividends for the foreseeable future. have never declared paid cash dividends our capital stock. currently intend retain any future earnings finance the operation and expansion our business and fund our share repurchase program, and not expect declare pay any cash dividends the foreseeable future. result, you may only receive return your investment our Class common stock the trading price your shares increases. The dual class structure our common stock and voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect concentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders our Class common stock; this will limit preclude your ability influence corporate matters. Our Class common stock has ten votes per share and our Class common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares Class common stock, including certain our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, together hold substantial majority the voting power our outstanding capital stock. Because the ten- -one voting ratio between our Class and Class common stock, the holders our Class common stock collectively control majority the combined voting power our common stock and therefore are able control all matters submitted our stockholders for approval long the shares Class common stock represent least % all outstanding shares our Class and Class common stock. This concentrated control will limit preclude your ability influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. Transfers holders Class common stock will generally result those shares converting Class common stock, subject limited exceptions, such certain transfers effected for estate planning charitable purposes. The conversion Class common stock Class common stock will have the effect, over time, increasing the relative voting power those holders Class common stock who retain their shares the long term. , for example, . Zuckerberg retains significant portion his holdings Class common stock for extended period time, could, the future, continue control majority the combined voting power our outstanding capital stock. Our status "controlled company" could make our Class common stock less attractive some investors otherwise harm our stock price. Because qualify "controlled company" under the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies, are not required have majority our board directors independent, nor are required have compensation committee independent nominating function. the future could elect not have majority our board directors independent not have compensation committee independent nominating function. Accordingly, should the interests our controlling stockholder differ from those other stockholders, the other stockholders may not have the same protections afforded stockholders companies that are subject all the corporate governance rules for Nasdaq-listed companies. Our status controlled company could make our Class common stock less attractive some investors otherwise harm our stock price. Delaware law and provisions our restated certificate incorporation and bylaws could make merger, tender offer, proxy contest difficult, thereby depressing the trading price our Class common stock.

Trends Our Monetization Facebook User Geography calculate our revenue Facebook user geography based our estimate the geography which impressions are delivered, virtual and digital goods are purchased, consumer hardware devices are shipped. define ARPU our total revenue given geography during given quarter, divided the average the number MAUs the geography the beginning and end the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources revenue, the number MAUs used this calculation only includes users Facebook and Messenger described the definition MAU above. The share revenue from users who are not also Facebook Messenger MAUs was not material. The geography our users affects our revenue and financial results because currently monetize users different geographies different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU regions such United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due the size and maturity those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU the United States & Canada region was more than times higher than the Asia-Pacific region. Note: Our revenue Facebook user geography the charts above geographically apportioned based our estimation the geographic location our Facebook users when they perform revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue disaggregated geography disclosure our consolidated financial statements where revenue geographically apportioned based the billing address the customer. Our annual worldwide ARPU , which represents the sum quarterly ARPU during such period, was $ , increase % from . Over this period, ARPU increased % the United States & Canada, % Europe, % Asia‑Pacific, and % Rest World. addition, user growth was more rapid geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such Asia‑Pacific and Rest World. expect that user growth the future will primarily concentrated those regions where ARPU relatively lower, such that worldwide ARPU may continue increase slower rate relative ARPU any geographic region, potentially decrease even ARPU increases each geographic region.

Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared accordance with . GAAP. The preparation these consolidated financial statements requires make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. evaluate our estimates and assumptions ongoing basis. Our estimates are based historical experience and various other assumptions that believe reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions conditions. accounting policy deemed critical requires accounting estimate made based assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain the time the estimate made, different estimates reasonably could have been used, changes the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with income taxes, loss contingencies, and valuation long-lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets and their associated estimated useful lives have the greatest potential impact our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, consider these our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information all our significant accounting policies, see Note —Summary Significant Accounting Policies the accompanying notes consolidated financial statements included Part , Item , "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" this Annual Report Form - . Income Taxes are subject income taxes the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment required determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties the application accounting principles and complex tax laws. record provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences the reported results operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, recognize deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases assets and liabilities, well for loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected apply taxable income for the years which those tax assets and liabilities are expected realized settled. recognize the deferred income tax effects change tax rates the period the enactment. record valuation allowance reduce our deferred tax assets the net amount that believe more likely than not realized. consider all available evidence, both positive and negative, including historical levels income, expectations and risks associated with estimates future taxable income, and ongoing tax planning strategies assessing the need for valuation allowance. recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only believe that more likely than not that the tax position will sustained examination the taxing authorities based the technical merits the position. These uncertain tax positions include our estimates for transfer pricing that have been developed based upon analyses appropriate arms-length prices. Similarly, our estimates related uncertain tax positions concerning research tax credits are based assessment whether our available documentation corroborating the nature our activities supporting the tax credits will sufficient. Although believe that have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions (including net interest and penalties), can provide assurance that the final tax outcome these matters will not materially different. make adjustments these reserves accordance with the income tax accounting guidance when facts and circumstances change, such the closing tax audit the refinement estimate. the extent that the final tax outcome these matters different from the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes the period which such determination made, and could have material impact our financial condition and operating results. Loss Contingencies are involved legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax government inquiries and investigations that arise the ordinary course business. Certain these matters include speculative claims for substantial indeterminate amounts damages. evaluate the associated developments regular basis and accrue liability when believe that both probable that loss has been incurred and the amount can reasonably estimated. determine there reasonable possibility that may incur loss and the loss range loss can estimated, disclose the possible loss the accompanying notes the consolidated financial statements the extent material. review the developments our contingencies that could affect the amount the provisions that have been previously recorded, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed. make adjustments our provisions and changes our disclosures accordingly reflect the impact negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment required determine both the probability loss and the estimated amount loss. The outcome these matters inherently uncertain. Therefore, one more these matters were resolved against for amounts excess management\' expectations, our results operations and financial condition, including particular reporting period which any such outcome becomes probable and estimable, could materially adversely affected. See Note —Commitments and Contingencies and Note —Income Taxes the accompanying notes our consolidated financial statements included Part , Item , "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" and Part , Item , "Legal Proceedings" this Annual Report Form - for additional information regarding these contingencies. Valuation Long-lived Assets including Goodwill, Intangible Assets and Estimated Useful Lives allocate the fair value purchase consideration the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based their estimated fair values. The excess the fair value purchase consideration over the fair values these identifiable assets and liabilities recorded goodwill. Such valuations require management make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect intangible assets. Significant estimates valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited , future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management\' estimates fair value are based upon assumptions believed reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation purchase consideration identifiable assets and liabilities affects our amortization expense, acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which not exceed one year from the acquisition date, may record adjustments the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset goodwill. Upon the conclusion the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded earnings. review goodwill for impairment least annually more frequently events changes circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value our single reporting unit below its carrying value. December , , impairment goodwill has been identified. Long-lived assets, including property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for possible impairment whenever events circumstances indicate that the carrying amount such assets may not recoverable. The evaluation performed the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent the cash flows other assets and liabilities. Recoverability these assets measured comparison the carrying amounts the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected generate from the use and eventual disposition. such review indicates that the carrying amount property and equipment and intangible assets not recoverable, the carrying amount such assets reduced fair value. have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented. The useful lives our long-lived assets including property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets are determined management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. The current estimate useful lives represents our best estimate based current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due changes future circumstances such changes our business operations, changes the planned use assets, and technological advancements. When change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount the asset accounted for prospectively and depreciated amortized over the revised estimated useful life. Historically changes useful lives have not resulted material changes our depreciation and amortization expense.

November , made $ billion payment related this matter and recorded the payment net against the tax liability included within other liabilities our consolidated balance sheets. the Altera Ninth Circuit Opinion reversed, would anticipate recording income tax benefit that time. Effective Tax Rate Items . Our effective tax rate the future will depend upon the proportion our income before provision for income taxes earned the United States and jurisdictions with tax rate lower than the . statutory rate, well number other factors, including excess tax benefits from share-based compensation, tax effects integrating intellectual property from acquisitions, settlement tax contingency items, tax effects changes our business, and the impact changes tax law. The proportion our income before provision for income taxes earned jurisdictions with tax rate lower than the . statutory rate will depend upon the proportion revenue and costs associated with the respective jurisdictions. The accounting for share-based compensation may increase decrease our effective tax rate based upon the difference between our share-based compensation expense and the deductions taken our tax return which depends upon the stock price the time employee award vesting. our stock price remains constant the January , price, expect our effective tax rate for will the high-teens. The range reflects expected effects from transfer intellectual property rights between Facebook entities that anticipate implementing . Integrating intellectual property from acquisitions into our business generally involves intercompany transactions that have the impact increasing our provision for income taxes. Consequently, our provision for income taxes and our effective tax rate may initially increase the period acquisition and integration. The magnitude this impact will depend upon the specific type, size, and taxing jurisdictions the intellectual property well the relative contribution income subsequent periods. Unrecognized Tax Benefits. December , , had net unrecognized tax benefits $ billion which were accrued other liabilities. These unrecognized tax benefits were predominantly accrued for uncertainties related transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, which includes licensing intellectual property, providing services and other transactions, well for uncertainties with our research tax credits. The ultimate settlement the liabilities will depend upon resolution tax audits, litigation, events that would otherwise change the assessment such items. Based upon the status litigation described below and the current status tax audits various jurisdictions, not anticipate material change such amounts within the next months. July , received Statutory Notice Deficiency (Notice) from the IRS related transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries conjunction with the examination the tax year. While the Notice applies only the tax year, the IRS stated that will also apply its position for tax years subsequent . not agree with the position the IRS and have filed petition the Tax Court challenging the Notice. The case scheduled for trial beginning February . January , , the IRS filed its Pretrial Memorandum the case stating that planned assert trial adjustment that higher than the adjustment stated the Notice. The IRS did not provide any information about how intends apply the revised adjustment future years. Based the information provided, believe that, the IRS prevails its updated position, this could result additional federal tax liability estimated, aggregate amount approximately $ billion excess the amounts our originally filed . return, plus interest and any penalties asserted. March , received second Notice from the IRS conjunction with the examination our through tax years. The IRS applied its position from the tax year each these years and also proposed new adjustments related other transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries and certain tax credits that claimed. the IRS prevails its position for these new adjustments, this could result additional federal tax liability approximately $ million excess the amounts our originally filed . returns, plus interest and any penalties asserted. not agree with the positions the IRS the second Notice and have filed petition the Tax Court challenging the second Notice. have previously accrued estimated unrecognized tax benefit consistent with the guidance ASC , Income Taxes , that lower than the potential additional federal tax liability from the positions taken the IRS the two Notices and its Pretrial Memorandum. addition, the IRS prevails its positions related transfer pricing with our foreign subsidiaries, the additional tax that would owe would partially offset reduction the tax that owe under the mandatory transition tax accumulated foreign earnings from the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (Tax Act).

When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required recorded fair value, consider the principal most advantageous market which would transact and the market-based risk measurements assumptions that market participants would use pricing the asset liability, such risks inherent valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value estimated applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level input that available and significant the fair value measurement: Level -Quoted prices active markets for identical assets liabilities. Level -Observable inputs other than quoted prices active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical similar assets liabilities inactive markets, other inputs that are observable can corroborated observable market data for substantially the full term the assets liabilities. Level -Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\' estimate assumptions that market participants would use pricing the asset liability. Our valuation techniques used measure the fair value cash equivalents and marketable debt securities were derived from quoted market prices alternative pricing sources and models utilizing observable market inputs. Accounts Receivable and Allowances Accounts receivable are recorded and carried the original invoiced amount less allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. make estimates for the allowance for doubtful accounts and allowance for unbilled receivables based upon our assessment various factors, including historical experience, the age the accounts receivable balances, credit quality our customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect our ability collect from customers. Property and Equipment Property and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under finance leases, are stated cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives the assets the remaining lease term, whichever shorter. The estimated useful lives property and equipment are described below: Property and Equipment Useful Life Network equipment Three years Buildings Three years Computer software, office equipment and other Two five years Finance lease right- -use assets Three years Leasehold improvements Lesser estimated useful life remaining lease term The useful lives our property and equipment are determined management when those assets are initially recognized and are routinely reviewed for the remaining estimated useful lives. Our current estimate useful lives represents the best estimate the useful lives based current facts and circumstances, but may differ from the actual useful lives due changes future circumstances such changes our business operations, changes the planned use assets, and technological advancements. When change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining carrying amount the asset accounted for prospectively and depreciated amortized over the revised estimated useful life. Historically changes useful lives have not resulted material changes our depreciation and amortization expense. Land and assets held within construction progress are not depreciated. Construction progress related the construction development property and equipment that have not yet been placed service for their intended use. The cost maintenance and repairs expensed incurred. When assets are retired otherwise disposed , the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain loss such sale disposal reflected income from operations. Lease Obligations January , , adopted Accounting Standards Update . - , Leases (Topic ) (ASU - ) using the modified retrospective transition approach applying the new standard all leases existing the date initial application. Results and disclosure requirements for reporting periods beginning after January , are presented under Topic , while prior period amounts have not been adjusted and continue reported accordance with our historical accounting under Topic . elected the package practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance, which allowed carryforward our historical lease classification, our assessment whether contract was contains lease, and our initial direct costs for any leases that existed prior January , . also elected combine our lease and non-lease components and keep leases with initial term months less off the balance sheet and recognize the associated lease payments the consolidated statements income straight-line basis over the lease term. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, apply portfolio approach effectively account for the operating lease right- -use (ROU) assets and lease liabilities. Upon adoption, recognized total ROU assets $ billion , with corresponding lease liabilities $ billion the consolidated balance sheets. This included $ million pre-existing finance lease ROU assets previously reported the network equipment within property and equipment, net. The ROU assets include adjustments for prepayments and accrued lease payments. The adoption did not impact our beginning retained earnings, our prior year consolidated statements income and statements cash flows. Under Topic , determine arrangement lease inception. ROU assets and lease liabilities are recognized commencement date based the present value remaining lease payments over the lease term. For this purpose, consider only payments that are fixed and determinable the time commencement. most our leases not provide implicit rate, use our incremental borrowing rate based the information available commencement date determining the present value lease payments. Our incremental borrowing rate hypothetical rate based our understanding what our credit rating would . The ROU asset also includes any lease payments made prior commencement and recorded net any lease incentives received. Our lease terms may include options extend terminate the lease when reasonably certain that will exercise such options. When determining the probability exercising such options, consider contract-based, asset-based, entity-based, and market-based factors. Our lease agreements may contain variable costs such common area maintenance, insurance, real estate taxes other costs. Variable lease costs are expensed incurred the consolidated statements income. Our lease agreements generally not contain any residual value guarantees restrictive covenants. Operating leases are included operating lease ROU assets, operating lease liabilities, current and operating lease liabilities, non-current our consolidated balance sheets. Finance leases are included property and equipment, accrued expenses and other current liabilities, and other liabilities our consolidated balance sheets. Loss Contingencies are involved legal proceedings, claims, and regulatory, tax government inquiries and investigations that arise the ordinary course business. Certain these matters include speculative claims for substantial indeterminate amounts damages. evaluate the developments regular basis and accrue liability when believe that both probable that loss has been incurred and the amount can reasonably estimated. determine there reasonable possibility that may incur loss and the loss range loss can estimated, disclose the possible loss the notes the consolidated financial statements the extent material. review the developments our contingencies that could affect the amount the provisions that has been previously recorded, and the matters and related possible losses disclosed. make adjustments our provisions and changes our disclosures accordingly reflect the impact negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice legal counsel, and updated information. Significant judgment required determine both the probability loss and the estimated amount loss. Business Combinations allocate the fair value purchase consideration the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based their estimated fair values. The excess the fair value purchase consideration over the fair values these identifiable assets and liabilities recorded goodwill. Such valuations require management make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect intangible assets. Significant estimates valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited , future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management\' estimates fair value are based upon assumptions believed reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, result, actual results may differ from estimates. Allocation purchase consideration identifiable assets and liabilities affects Company amortization expense, acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over the useful life, whereas any indefinite lived intangible assets, including goodwill, are not amortized. During the measurement period, which not exceed one year from the acquisition date, may record adjustments the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset goodwill. Upon the conclusion the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded earnings. Long-lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangibles Assets evaluate the recoverability property and equipment and acquired finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events circumstances indicate that the carrying amount such assets may not recoverable. The evaluation performed the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent the cash flows other assets and liabilities. Recoverability these assets measured comparison the carrying amounts the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected generate from the use and eventual disposition. such review indicates that the carrying amount property and equipment and intangible assets not recoverable, the carrying amount such assets reduced fair value. have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented. review goodwill for impairment least annually more frequently events changes circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value our single reporting unit below its carrying value. December , , impairment goodwill has been identified. Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives the assets. routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets. change the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance amortized depreciated over the revised estimated useful life. Foreign Currency Generally, the functional currency our international subsidiaries the local currency. translate the financial statements these subsidiaries . dollars using month-end rates exchange for assets and liabilities, and average rates exchange for revenue, costs, and expenses. Translation gains and losses are recorded accumulated other comprehensive loss component stockholders\' equity.
