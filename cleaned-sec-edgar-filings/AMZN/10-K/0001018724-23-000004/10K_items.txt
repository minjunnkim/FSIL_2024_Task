Fair Value Financial Instruments Fair value defined the price that would received sell asset paid transfer liability orderly transaction between market participants the measurement date. increase the comparability fair value measures, the following hierarchy prioritizes the inputs valuation methodologies used measure fair value: Level — Valuations based quoted prices for identical assets and liabilities active markets. Level — Valuations based observable inputs other than quoted prices included Level , such quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities active markets, quoted prices for identical similar assets and liabilities markets that are not active, other inputs that are observable can corroborated observable market data. Level — Valuations based unobservable inputs reflecting our own assumptions, consistent with reasonably available assumptions made other market participants. These valuations require significant judgment. measure the fair value money market funds and certain marketable equity securities based quoted prices active markets for identical assets liabilities. Other marketable securities were valued either based recent trades securities inactive markets based quoted market prices similar instruments and other significant inputs derived from corroborated observable market data. did not hold significant amounts marketable securities categorized Level assets December , and . hold equity warrants giving the right acquire stock other companies. December , and , these warrants had fair value $ billion and $ billion, and are recorded within “ Other assets ” our consolidated balance sheets with gains and losses recognized “Other income (expense), net” our consolidated statements operations. These warrants are primarily classified Level assets. Cash and Cash Equivalents classify all highly liquid instruments with original maturity three months less cash equivalents. Inventories Inventories, consisting products available for sale, are primarily accounted for using the first- , first-out method, and are valued the lower cost and net realizable value. This valuation requires make judgments, based currently available information, about the likely method disposition, such through sales individual customers, returns product vendors, liquidations, and expected recoverable values each disposition category. The inventory valuation allowance, representing write-down inventory, was $ billion and $ billion December , and . provide Fulfillment Amazon services connection with certain our sellers’ programs. Third-party sellers maintain ownership their inventory, regardless whether fulfillment provided the third-party sellers, and therefore these products are not included our inventories. also purchase electronic device components from variety suppliers and use several contract manufacturers provide manufacturing services for our products.

Software Development Costs incur software development costs related products sold, leased, marketed external users, internal-use software, and our websites. Software development costs capitalized were not significant for the years presented. All other costs, including those related design maintenance, are expensed incurred.

Incentives that receive from property and equipment vendors are recorded reduction our costs. Property includes buildings and land that own, along with property have acquired under build- -suit lease arrangements when have control over the building during the construction period and finance lease arrangements. Equipment includes assets such servers and networking equipment, heavy equipment, and other fulfillment equipment. Depreciation and amortization recorded straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives the assets (generally the lesser years the remaining life the underlying building, four years prior January , and five years subsequent January , for our servers, five years prior January , and six years subsequent January , for our networking equipment, ten years for heavy equipment, and three ten years for other fulfillment equipment). Depreciation and amortization expense classified within the corresponding operating expense categories our consolidated statements operations. Leases categorize leases with contractual terms longer than twelve months either operating finance. Finance leases are generally those leases that allow substantially utilize pay for the entire asset over its estimated life. Assets acquired under finance leases are recorded “Property and equipment, net.” All other leases are categorized operating leases. Our leases generally have terms that range from one ten years for equipment and one twenty years for property.

When have the option extend the lease term, terminate the lease before the contractual expiration date, purchase the leased asset, and reasonably certain that will exercise the option, consider the option determining the classification and measurement the lease. Our leases may include variable payments based measures that include changes price indices, market interest rates, the level sales physical store, which are expensed incurred. Costs associated with operating lease assets are recognized straight-line basis within operating expenses over the term the lease. Finance lease assets are amortized within operating expenses straight-line basis over the shorter the estimated useful lives the assets , the instance where title does not transfer the end the lease term, the lease term. The interest component finance lease included interest expense and recognized using the effective interest method over the lease term. establish assets and liabilities for the present value estimated future costs retire long-lived assets the termination expiration lease. Such assets are amortized over the lease period into operating expense, and the recorded liabilities are accreted the future value the estimated retirement costs. Financing Obligations record assets and liabilities for estimated construction costs under build- -suit lease arrangements when have control over the building during the construction period. continue control the building after the construction period, the arrangement classified financing obligation instead lease. The building depreciated over the shorter its useful life the term the obligation. not control the building after the construction period ends, the assets and liabilities for construction costs are derecognized, and classify the lease operating. Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets evaluate goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually more frequently when event occurs circumstances change that indicate the carrying value may not recoverable. may elect utilize qualitative assessment evaluate whether more likely than not that the fair value reporting unit indefinite-lived intangible asset less than its carrying value and , perform quantitative test. compare the carrying value each reporting unit and indefinite-lived intangible asset its estimated fair value and the fair value determined less than the carrying value, recognize impairment loss for the difference. estimate the fair value the reporting units using discounted cash flows. Forecasts future cash flows are based our best estimate future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily expected category expansion, pricing, market segment share, and general economic conditions. completed the required annual impairment test goodwill for all reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets April , , resulting impairments.

Marketable fixed income securities are classified available-for-sale and reported fair value with unrealized gains and losses included “Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss).” Each reporting period, evaluate whether declines fair value below carrying value are due expected credit losses, well our ability and intent hold the investment until forecasted recovery occurs. Expected credit losses are recorded allowance through “Other income (expense), net” our consolidated statements operations.

For long-lived assets used operations, including lease assets, impairment losses are only recorded the asset’ carrying amount not recoverable through its undiscounted, probability-weighted future cash flows. measure the impairment loss based the difference between the carrying amount and estimated fair value. Long-lived assets are considered held for sale when certain criteria are met, including when management has committed plan sell the asset, the asset available for sale its immediate condition, and the sale probable within one year the reporting date.
