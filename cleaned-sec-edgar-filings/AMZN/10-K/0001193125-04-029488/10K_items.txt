May Experience Significant Fluctuations Our Operating Results and Rate Growth Due our limited operating history, our evolving business model, and the unpredictability our industry, may not able accurately forecast our rate growth. base our current and future expense levels and our investment plans estimates future net sales and rate growth. Our expenses and investments are large extent fixed. may not able adjust our spending quickly enough our net sales fall short our expectations. Our revenue and operating profit growth depends the continued growth demand for the products offered our sellers, and our business affected general economic and business conditions throughout the world. softening demand, whether caused changes consumer preferences weakening the . global economies, may result decreased revenue growth. Terrorist attacks and armed hostilities create economic and consumer uncertainty that could adversely affect our revenue growth. Such events could create delays , and increase the cost , product shipments, which may decrease demand. Revenue growth may not sustainable and our company-wide percentage growth rate may decrease the future.

Finally, our ability receive inbound inventory efficiently ship completed orders customers may negatively affected number factors, including dependence limited number shipping companies, inclement weather, fire, flood, power loss, earthquakes, labor disputes, acts war terrorism, acts God. Third parties either drop-ship otherwise fulfill increasing portion our customers\x92 orders, and are increasingly reliant the reliability, quality, and future procurement their services.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures Regulation , \x93Conditions for Use Non-GAAP Financial Measures,\x94 and other provisions the Securities Exchange Act (\x93 Act\x94) define and prescribe the conditions for use certain non-GAAP financial information. believe that certain our financial measures which meet the definition non-GAAP financial measure are important supplemental information investors. provide: \x93consolidated segment operating income (loss),\x94 \x93pro forma net income (loss),\x94 \x93pro forma net earnings (loss) per share,\x94 and \x93free cash flow.\x94 use these non-GAAP financial measures for internal managerial purposes, when publicly providing guidance possible future results, and means evaluate period- -period comparisons. These non-GAAP financial measures are used addition and conjunction with results presented accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not relied upon the exclusion GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional way viewing aspects our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide more complete understanding factors and trends affecting our business. Management strongly encourages investors review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports their entirety and not rely any single financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, may not possible compare these financial measures with other companies\x92 non-GAAP financial measures having the same similar names. For example, certain companies disclose financial measure earnings before certain charges such interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, commonly referred EBITDA. considered the use EBITDA supplemental performance measure GAAP, but believe consolidated segment operating income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) are superior for our Company certain periodic costs associated with our invested capital, such fixed asset depreciation expense and amortization software development costs, and certain costs associated with our capital structure, such interest expense, are relevant and important factors affecting our management decisions. For information about our financial results reported accordance with GAAP, see Item Part , \x93Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\x94 For quantitative reconciliation our non-GAAP financial measures the most comparable GAAP financial measures, see \x93Reconciliation Tables\x94 below. Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss) measure operating results our segments using internal performance measure direct segment operating expenses that excludes: \x95 Stock-based compensation; \x95 Amortization other intangibles; and \x95 Restructuring-related and other. These operating expense line items are not allocated segment results, and all other centrally-incurred operating costs are fully allocated segment results. The sum our individual segment results consolidated segment operating income (loss), which reconcile GAAP operating income (loss). Pursuant SEC staff interpretations Regulation , when presented our financial statement footnotes, consolidated segment operating income GAAP financial measure; however, since also present this financial measure outside the context our financial statement footnotes, have included this financial measure our discussion non-GAAP financial measures. use consolidated segment operating income (loss), and ratios based , manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our management evaluates consolidated segment income (loss) because excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control that believe are not characteristic our underlying business operations for the period which they are recorded, both. Items Excluded From Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss) Stock-Based Compensation exclude stock-based compensation for the following reasons: \x95 Stock-based compensation expense excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement financial performance, although consider the dilutive impact our investors when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly; \x95 Stock-based compensation charges gains are non-cash; and \x95 The measurement stock-based compensation determined under variety methods depending the underlying award. These methods include: ( ) fixed accounting stock options granted market prices, resulting compensation expense, ( ) variable accounting certain stock options and restricted stock units, resulting unpredictable charges gains beyond our control, and ( ) fixed accounting for certain restricted stock units, resulting the estimated fair value the award recognized over the service period. record the employer portion payroll tax expense, cash expense, resulting from exercises stock-based awards \x93Fulfillment,\x94 \x93Marketing,\x94 \x93Technology and content,\x94 and \x93General and administrative\x94 our consolidated statements operations and not include such expenses \x93Stock-based compensation.\x94 Amortization Other Intangibles exclude \x93Amortization other intangibles\x94 for the following reasons: \x95 Amortization other intangibles excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement financial performance; \x95 Amortization other intangibles non-cash charge current operations; and \x95 Amortization other intangibles has diminished, currently immaterial, and scheduled fully amortize the end . Restructuring-Related and Other exclude restructuring-related and other expenses, which are cash and non-cash amounts, for the following reasons: \x95 have implemented only one restructuring event our history, which announced January , and accordingly believe internally that this line item not important understanding our quarterly trends other line items; \x95 Since not regularly have restructuring-related charges, the exclusion such charges from prior periods provides better comparability our results operations viewed management; and \x95 Our restructuring-related and other charges have diminished, and except for periodic adjustments our estimates that may required from time time, not currently expect record additional restructuring-related charges the foreseeable future. Impairment Goodwill , the future, incur impairment losses our goodwill, such charges would excluded from consolidated segment operating income (loss) since they would non-cash, and not the immediate control management. have elected perform our annual analysis during the fourth calendar quarter each year. indicators impairment were identified during the year ended December , . Limitations Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss) Consolidated segment operating income (loss) has certain limitations. First, because excludes \x93Stock-based compensation,\x94 the financial measure does not include all expenses primarily related our workforce. compensate for this limitation providing supplemental information about stock-based compensation the face our consolidated statements operations and the footnotes our financial statements. also provide supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards, including their dilutive effect shareholders, the footnotes our financial statements. See Item Part \x93Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\x97Note \x97Description Business and Accounting Policies\x94 for presentation our stock-based compensation expense calculated consistent basis for all awards using the fair value method prescribed under SFAS . , Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation , well total outstanding stock-based awards and related activity. Second, consolidated segment operating income (loss) excludes \x93Restructuring-related and other.\x94 For companies that periodically undergo restructuring events, excluding such costs from performance measures could provide incomplete summary ongoing costs that would affect future cash flows. However, compensate for this limitation disclosing cash flow measures, including operating cash flow, that incorporate all ongoing cash obligations associated with our January restructuring event and providing disclosure future estimated cash flows and remaining commitments associated with this event. See Item Part , \x93Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\x97Note \x97Restructuring-Related and Other.\x94 There can assurance that will not undertake another restructuring event the future that would affect future cash flows. have restructuring event the future, will -evaluate our decision exclude such charges from our consolidated segment operating income (loss) based those future facts and circumstances that time. Pro Forma Net Income (Loss) Pro forma net income (loss), including the related pro forma net earnings (loss) per share, which reconcile net income (loss) and net earnings (loss) per share, excludes, addition the line items described above excluded from consolidated segment operating income (loss), the following line items our consolidated statements operations: \x95 Remeasurement % PEACS and other; \x95 Equity losses equity-method investees, net; and \x95 Cumulative effect change accounting principle. use pro forma net income (loss), and ratios based , manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our decision use this financial measure due the fact that pro forma net income (loss) excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control are not characteristic our underlying business operations for the period which they are recorded, both. Items Excluded From Pro Forma Net Income (Loss) See \x93Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)\x97Items Excluded from Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)\x94 for explanation \x93Stock-based compensation,\x94 \x93Amortization other intangibles,\x94 \x93Restructuring-related and other,\x94 and \x93Impairment goodwill.\x94 Remeasurement % PEACS and Other The majority \x93Remeasurement % PEACS and other\x94 consists gains charges due our quarterly remeasurement the principal our % PEACS from Euros . Dollars. exclude the effect these periodic remeasurements from our pro forma net income (loss) because the ultimate cash effect resulting from changes exchange rates inherently uncertain. These gains charges would only affect near-term cash flows redeem , certain cases, restructure, our % PEACS the next several years, rather than over longer term maturity . Because these charges and gains vary based exchange rates between the . Dollar and Euro, these amounts are beyond our immediate control and are difficult predict for future periods. Additionally, exclude gains charges associated with remeasurements foreign-currency denominated intercompany balances. exclude these amounts because they are beyond our immediate control and are difficult predict for future periods. This line item also includes $ million losses associated with the redemption our % Senior Discount Notes and portion our % Convertible Subordinated Notes and $ million losses associated with the termination our Euro Currency Swap. Equity Losses Equity-Method Investees, Net exclude equity losses equity-method investees, net, because generates potential non-cash gains losses, which are based the financial results other companies that not manage control and are difficult predict. addition, believe these non-cash gains and losses are not indicative our financial operating performance. Finally, recent quarters, these amounts represented insignificant charges and, absent future investments, expect this trend continue. Cumulative Effect Change Accounting Principle exclude cumulative effect change accounting principle because generates non-cash charges, which believe are not indicative our financial operating performance. Limitations Pro Forma Net Income (Loss) Pro forma net income (loss) has the same limitations consolidated segment operating income. See \x93Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)\x97Limitations Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)\x94 above. addition, when the % PEACS are retired, whether early redemption restructuring, maturity , the foreign currency effect changes the exchange ratio between the . Dollar and the Euro will result cash effect. compensate for this limitation disclosing the effect currency movements our % PEACS our consolidated statements operations and presenting the fair value our % PEACS the notes our financial statements. See Item Part , \x93Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\x97Note \x97Long-Term Debt and Other.\x94 Free Cash Flow Free cash flow, which reconcile \x93Net cash provided (used ) operating activities,\x94 cash flow from operations reduced \x93Purchases fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.\x94 use free cash flow, and ratios based , conduct and evaluate our business because, although similar cash flow from operations, believe more conservative measure cash flows since purchases fixed assets are necessary component ongoing operations. limited circumstances where proceeds from sales fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since not anticipate being net seller fixed assets, expect free cash flow less than operating cash flows. Limitations Free Cash Flow Free cash flow has limitations due the fact that does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made capital lease obligations. Therefore, believe important view free cash flow complement our entire consolidated statements cash flows.

These non-GAAP financial measures are used addition and conjunction with results presented accordance with GAAP. These non-GAAP financial measures should not relied upon the exclusion GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures reflect additional way viewing aspects our operations that, when viewed with our GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliations corresponding GAAP financial measures, provide more complete understanding factors and trends affecting our business. Management strongly encourages investors review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports their entirety and not rely any single financial measure. Because non-GAAP financial measures are not standardized, may not possible compare these financial measures with other companies\x92 non-GAAP financial measures having the same similar names. For example, certain companies disclose financial measure earnings before certain charges such interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization, commonly referred EBITDA. considered the use EBITDA supplemental performance measure GAAP, but believe consolidated segment operating income (loss) and pro forma net income (loss) are superior for our Company certain periodic costs associated with our invested capital, such fixed asset depreciation expense and amortization software development costs, and certain costs associated with our capital structure, such interest expense, are relevant and important factors affecting our management decisions. For information about our financial results reported accordance with GAAP, see Item Part , \x93Financial Statements and Supplementary Data.\x94 For quantitative reconciliation our non-GAAP financial measures the most comparable GAAP financial measures, see \x93Reconciliation Tables\x94 below. Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss) measure operating results our segments using internal performance measure direct segment operating expenses that excludes: \x95 Stock-based compensation; \x95 Amortization other intangibles; and \x95 Restructuring-related and other. These operating expense line items are not allocated segment results, and all other centrally-incurred operating costs are fully allocated segment results. The sum our individual segment results consolidated segment operating income (loss), which reconcile GAAP operating income (loss). Pursuant SEC staff interpretations Regulation , when presented our financial statement footnotes, consolidated segment operating income GAAP financial measure; however, since also present this financial measure outside the context our financial statement footnotes, have included this financial measure our discussion non-GAAP financial measures. use consolidated segment operating income (loss), and ratios based , manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our management evaluates consolidated segment income (loss) because excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control that believe are not characteristic our underlying business operations for the period which they are recorded, both. Items Excluded From Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss) Stock-Based Compensation exclude stock-based compensation for the following reasons: \x95 Stock-based compensation expense excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement financial performance, although consider the dilutive impact our investors when awarding stock-based compensation and value such awards accordingly; \x95 Stock-based compensation charges gains are non-cash; and \x95 The measurement stock-based compensation determined under variety methods depending the underlying award. These methods include: ( ) fixed accounting stock options granted market prices, resulting compensation expense, ( ) variable accounting certain stock options and restricted stock units, resulting unpredictable charges gains beyond our control, and ( ) fixed accounting for certain restricted stock units, resulting the estimated fair value the award recognized over the service period. record the employer portion payroll tax expense, cash expense, resulting from exercises stock-based awards \x93Fulfillment,\x94 \x93Marketing,\x94 \x93Technology and content,\x94 and \x93General and administrative\x94 our consolidated statements operations and not include such expenses \x93Stock-based compensation.\x94 Amortization Other Intangibles exclude \x93Amortization other intangibles\x94 for the following reasons: \x95 Amortization other intangibles excluded from our internal operating plans and measurement financial performance; \x95 Amortization other intangibles non-cash charge current operations; and \x95 Amortization other intangibles has diminished, currently immaterial, and scheduled fully amortize the end . Restructuring-Related and Other exclude restructuring-related and other expenses, which are cash and non-cash amounts, for the following reasons: \x95 have implemented only one restructuring event our history, which announced January , and accordingly believe internally that this line item not important understanding our quarterly trends other line items; \x95 Since not regularly have restructuring-related charges, the exclusion such charges from prior periods provides better comparability our results operations viewed management; and \x95 Our restructuring-related and other charges have diminished, and except for periodic adjustments our estimates that may required from time time, not currently expect record additional restructuring-related charges the foreseeable future. Impairment Goodwill , the future, incur impairment losses our goodwill, such charges would excluded from consolidated segment operating income (loss) since they would non-cash, and not the immediate control management. have elected perform our annual analysis during the fourth calendar quarter each year. indicators impairment were identified during the year ended December , . Limitations Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss) Consolidated segment operating income (loss) has certain limitations. First, because excludes \x93Stock-based compensation,\x94 the financial measure does not include all expenses primarily related our workforce. compensate for this limitation providing supplemental information about stock-based compensation the face our consolidated statements operations and the footnotes our financial statements. also provide supplemental information about outstanding stock-based awards, including their dilutive effect shareholders, the footnotes our financial statements. See Item Part \x93Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\x97Note \x97Description Business and Accounting Policies\x94 for presentation our stock-based compensation expense calculated consistent basis for all awards using the fair value method prescribed under SFAS . , Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation , well total outstanding stock-based awards and related activity. Second, consolidated segment operating income (loss) excludes \x93Restructuring-related and other.\x94 For companies that periodically undergo restructuring events, excluding such costs from performance measures could provide incomplete summary ongoing costs that would affect future cash flows. However, compensate for this limitation disclosing cash flow measures, including operating cash flow, that incorporate all ongoing cash obligations associated with our January restructuring event and providing disclosure future estimated cash flows and remaining commitments associated with this event. See Item Part , \x93Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\x97Note \x97Restructuring-Related and Other.\x94 There can assurance that will not undertake another restructuring event the future that would affect future cash flows. have restructuring event the future, will -evaluate our decision exclude such charges from our consolidated segment operating income (loss) based those future facts and circumstances that time. Pro Forma Net Income (Loss) Pro forma net income (loss), including the related pro forma net earnings (loss) per share, which reconcile net income (loss) and net earnings (loss) per share, excludes, addition the line items described above excluded from consolidated segment operating income (loss), the following line items our consolidated statements operations: \x95 Remeasurement % PEACS and other; \x95 Equity losses equity-method investees, net; and \x95 Cumulative effect change accounting principle. use pro forma net income (loss), and ratios based , manage and evaluate our business operations and overall financial performance. Our decision use this financial measure due the fact that pro forma net income (loss) excludes certain cash and non-cash items that are either beyond our immediate control are not characteristic our underlying business operations for the period which they are recorded, both. Items Excluded From Pro Forma Net Income (Loss) See \x93Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)\x97Items Excluded from Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)\x94 for explanation \x93Stock-based compensation,\x94 \x93Amortization other intangibles,\x94 \x93Restructuring-related and other,\x94 and \x93Impairment goodwill.\x94 Remeasurement % PEACS and Other The majority \x93Remeasurement % PEACS and other\x94 consists gains charges due our quarterly remeasurement the principal our % PEACS from Euros . Dollars. exclude the effect these periodic remeasurements from our pro forma net income (loss) because the ultimate cash effect resulting from changes exchange rates inherently uncertain. These gains charges would only affect near-term cash flows redeem , certain cases, restructure, our % PEACS the next several years, rather than over longer term maturity . Because these charges and gains vary based exchange rates between the . Dollar and Euro, these amounts are beyond our immediate control and are difficult predict for future periods. Additionally, exclude gains charges associated with remeasurements foreign-currency denominated intercompany balances. exclude these amounts because they are beyond our immediate control and are difficult predict for future periods. This line item also includes $ million losses associated with the redemption our % Senior Discount Notes and portion our % Convertible Subordinated Notes and $ million losses associated with the termination our Euro Currency Swap. Equity Losses Equity-Method Investees, Net exclude equity losses equity-method investees, net, because generates potential non-cash gains losses, which are based the financial results other companies that not manage control and are difficult predict. addition, believe these non-cash gains and losses are not indicative our financial operating performance. Finally, recent quarters, these amounts represented insignificant charges and, absent future investments, expect this trend continue. Cumulative Effect Change Accounting Principle exclude cumulative effect change accounting principle because generates non-cash charges, which believe are not indicative our financial operating performance. Limitations Pro Forma Net Income (Loss) Pro forma net income (loss) has the same limitations consolidated segment operating income. See \x93Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)\x97Limitations Consolidated Segment Operating Income (Loss)\x94 above. addition, when the % PEACS are retired, whether early redemption restructuring, maturity , the foreign currency effect changes the exchange ratio between the . Dollar and the Euro will result cash effect. compensate for this limitation disclosing the effect currency movements our % PEACS our consolidated statements operations and presenting the fair value our % PEACS the notes our financial statements. See Item Part , \x93Financial Statements and Supplementary Data\x97Note \x97Long-Term Debt and Other.\x94 Free Cash Flow Free cash flow, which reconcile \x93Net cash provided (used ) operating activities,\x94 cash flow from operations reduced \x93Purchases fixed assets, including internal-use software and website development.\x94 use free cash flow, and ratios based , conduct and evaluate our business because, although similar cash flow from operations, believe more conservative measure cash flows since purchases fixed assets are necessary component ongoing operations. limited circumstances where proceeds from sales fixed assets exceed purchases, free cash flow would exceed cash flow from operations. However, since not anticipate being net seller fixed assets, expect free cash flow less than operating cash flows. Limitations Free Cash Flow Free cash flow has limitations due the fact that does not represent the residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures. For example, free cash flow does not incorporate payments made capital lease obligations. Therefore, believe important view free cash flow complement our entire consolidated statements cash flows.
