Risks Related Our Businesses and Industries face intense competition. not continue innovate and provide products and services that are useful users, may not remain competitive, and our revenues and operating results could adversely affected. Our businesses are rapidly evolving, intensely competitive, and subject changing technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions new products and services. Competing successfully depends heavily our ability accurately anticipate technology developments and deliver innovative products and technologies the marketplace rapidly and, for Google, provide products and services that make our search results and ads relevant and useful for our users. our businesses evolve, the competitive pressure innovate will encompass wider range products and services, including products and services that may outside our historical core business. result, must continue invest significant resources research and development, including through acquisitions, order enhance our search technology and our existing products and services, and introduce new products and services that people can easily and effectively use. have many competitors different industries, including general purpose search engines and information services; vertical search engines and -commerce websites; social networks; other forms advertising and online advertising platforms and networks; companies that design, manufacture, and market consumer electronic products; providers enterprise cloud services and digital video services; and digital assistant providers. Our current and potential domestic and international competitors range from large and established companies emerging start-ups. Some large companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users, and they can use their experiences and resources ways that could affect our competitive position, including making acquisitions, continuing invest heavily research and development, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether not meritorious), and continuing compete aggressively for advertisers and websites. Emerging start-ups may able innovate and provide products and services faster than can may foresee the consumer need for products and services before . addition, new products and services can sometimes present new and difficult technological and legal challenges, which may negatively impact our brands and demand for our products and services and adversely impact our revenues and operating results. Our operating results would also suffer our innovations are not responsive the needs our users, advertisers, and Google Network Members; are not appropriately timed with market opportunities; are not effectively brought market. technology continues develop, our competitors may able offer user experiences that are, that are seen , substantially similar better than ours. This may force compete different ways and expend significant resources order remain competitive. our competitors are more successful than are developing compelling products attracting and retaining users, advertisers, and content providers, our revenues and operating results could adversely affected. generate substantially all our revenues from advertising, and reduced spending advertisers loss partners could harm our business. generated % total revenues from advertising . Many our advertisers, companies that distribute our products and services, digital publishers, and content partners can terminate their contracts with any time. Those partners may not continue business with not create more value (such increased numbers users customers, new sales leads, increased brand awareness, more effective monetization) than their available alternatives. not provide superior value deliver advertisements efficiently and competitively, could see decrease revenue and other adverse impacts our business. addition, expenditures advertisers tend cyclical, reflecting overall economic conditions and budgeting and buying patterns. Adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have material negative impact user activity and the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers reduce the amounts they spend advertising, which could adversely affect our revenues and business. Our ongoing investment new businesses and new products, services, and technologies inherently risky, and could disrupt our current operations. have invested and expect continue invest new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The creation Alphabet new holding company and the investments that are making across various areas Google and Other Bets are reflection our ongoing efforts innovate and provide products and services that Alphabet Inc. are useful users. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including insufficient revenues from such investments offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return capital our investments, distraction management from current operations, use alternative investment compensation structures, and unidentified issues not discovered our due diligence such strategies and offerings that could cause fail realize the anticipated benefits such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, assurance can given that such strategies and offerings will successful and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. More people are using devices other than desktop computers access the Internet and accessing new devices make search queries. manufacturers and users not widely adopt versions our search technology, products, operating systems developed for these devices, our business could adversely affected. The number people who access the Internet through devices other than desktop computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, handheld computers such laptops and tablets, video game consoles, digital assistants, and television set-top devices, increasing dramatically. The functionality and user experience associated with some alternative devices may make the use our products and services through such devices more difficult ( just different) and the versions our products and services developed for these devices may not compelling users, manufacturers, distributors alternative devices. Each manufacturer distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work viewable these devices result. Some manufacturers may also elect not include our products their devices. addition, search queries are increasingly being undertaken via “apps” tailored particular devices social media platforms, which could affect our search and advertising business over time. new devices and platforms are continually being released, difficult predict the problems may encounter adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. expect continue devote significant resources the creation, support, and maintenance products and services across multiple platforms and devices. are unable attract and retain substantial number alternative device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users our products and services, are slow develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices and platforms, will fail capture the opportunities available consumers and advertisers continue exist dynamic, multi-screen environment. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and anticipate downward pressure our operating margin the future. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time result number factors, including: • increasing competition, • changes property mix, platform mix, device mix, and geographical mix, • the challenges maintaining our growth rate our revenues increase higher levels, • the evolution the online advertising market, including the increasing variety online platforms for advertising, and the other markets which participate, and • the rate user adoption our products, services, and technologies. believe our margins could experience downward pressure result increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects our business well the continuing shift mobile, changes device mix, and the contribution new businesses overall revenue. For instance, the margin revenues generate from our Google Network Members significantly less than the margin revenues generate from advertising Google properties. Consequently, our margins will experience downward pressure greater percentage our revenues comes from ads placed our Google Network Members' properties compared revenues generated through ads placed Google properties. Additionally, the margin earn revenues generated from our Google Network Members could decrease the future pay even larger percentage advertising fees our Google Network Members. Furthermore, our multi-device world, generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile and newer advertising formats, and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. also expect our traffic acquisition costs (TAC) paid our distribution partners increase due changes device mix between mobile, desktop, and tablet, partner mix, partner agreement terms, and the percentage queries channeled through paid access points. Additionally, our margins could experience downward pressure because the margin the sale digital content, hardware products, and cloud-based services have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search . Further, our margins could impacted adversely spend proportionately larger amount promote new products and services distribute certain products invest more heavily our innovation efforts across the Company (such our Other Bets businesses) than have historically. Alphabet Inc. are subject increasing regulatory scrutiny that may negatively impact our business. Additionally, changes policies governing wide range topics may adversely affect our business. The growth our company and our expansion into variety new fields involves variety new regulatory issues, and have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny have grown. For instance, various regulatory agencies are reviewing aspects our search and other businesses. continue cooperate with the European Commission and other regulatory authorities around the world investigations they are conducting with respect our business. Legislators and regulators may make legal and regulatory changes, interpret and apply existing laws policies, ways that make our products and services less useful our users, require incur substantial costs, expose unanticipated civil criminal liability, cause change our business practices.

These changes could negatively impact our business and results operations material ways. variety new and existing laws could subject claims otherwise harm our business. are subject numerous . and foreign laws and regulations covering wide variety subject matters. New laws and regulations ( new interpretations existing laws and regulations) may also impact our business. For example, current and new patent laws such . patent laws and European patent laws may affect the ability companies, including , protect their innovations and defend against claims patent infringement. Similarly, changes copyright laws being considered Europe and elsewhere may increase costs require companies, including , change cease offering certain existing services. The costs compliance with these laws and regulations are high and are likely increase the future. Claims have been, may , threatened and filed against under both . and foreign laws for defamation, invasion privacy and other tort claims, unlawful activity, patent, copyright and trademark infringement, product liability, other theories based the nature and content the materials searched and the ads posted our users, our products and services, content generated our users. Furthermore, many these laws not contemplate address the unique issues raised number our new businesses, products, services and technologies. addition, the applicability and scope these laws, interpreted the courts, remain uncertain. For example, the laws relating the liability providers online services are currently unsettled both within the . and abroad. addition, other laws that could subject claims otherwise harm our business include, among others: • rely statutory safe harbors, set forth the Digital Millennium Copyright Act the United States and the -Commerce Directive Europe, against copyright liability for various linking, caching, and hosting activities. Any legislation court rulings impacting these safe harbors may adversely impact . • The General Data Protection Regulation, coming into effect Europe May , which creates range new compliance obligations, and increases financial penalties for noncompliance significantly. • Court decisions such the ‘right forgotten’ ruling issued the European court, which allows individuals demand that Google remove search results about them certain instances, may limit the content can show our users and impose significant operational burdens. • Various . and international laws that restrict the distribution materials considered harmful children and impose additional restrictions the ability online services collect information from minors. • Data protection laws passed many states and certain countries outside the . that require notification users when there security breach for personal data, such California’ Information Practices Act. • Data localization laws, which generally mandate that certain types data collected particular country stored and processed within that country. face risks and costs overseas our products and services are offered international markets and may subject additional regulations. Any failure our part comply with these laws and regulations can result negative publicity and diversion management time and effort and may subject significant liabilities and other penalties. are regularly subject claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings that may result adverse outcomes. are regularly subject claims, suits, and government investigations involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, consumer protection, tax, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated our users, goods and services offered advertisers publishers using our platforms, and other matters. The manufacturing and sale expanded suite hardware products further exposes the risk product liability and other litigation well consumer protection concerns related product defects, well health and safety, hazardous materials usage, and other environmental concerns. may also subject claims, including product warranty claims, users experience service disruptions, failures, other issues. addition, our businesses face intellectual property litigation, Alphabet Inc. further discussed later, that exposes the risk exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit our ability sell products and services. Such claims, suits, and government investigations are inherently uncertain and their results cannot predicted with certainty. Regardless the outcome, any these types legal proceedings can have adverse impact because legal costs, diversion management resources, and other factors.

Defense any such actions could costly and involve significant time and attention our management and other resources, may result monetary liabilities penalties, and may require change our business adverse manner. Privacy concerns relating our technology could damage our reputation and deter current and potential users from using our products and services. From time time, concerns have been expressed about whether our products, services, processes compromise the privacy users and others. Concerns about our practices with regard the collection, use, disclosure, security personal information other privacy related matters, even unfounded, could damage our reputation and adversely affect our operating results. addition, nearly all our products and services are web-based, the amount data store for our users our servers (including personal information) has been increasing. Any systems failure compromise our security that results the release our users’ data could seriously harm our reputation and brand and, therefore, our business, and impair our ability attract and retain users. expect continue expend significant resources create world-class security protections that shield against theft and security breaches. The risk that these types events could seriously harm our business likely increase expand the number web-based products and services offer and operate more countries, and cyber attacks third parties become more sophisticated and targeted. Regulatory authorities around the world are considering number legislative and regulatory proposals concerning data protection, including measures ensure that our encryption users’ data does not hinder law enforcement agencies’ access that data. addition, the interpretation and application consumer and data protection laws the ., Europe and elsewhere are often uncertain and flux. possible that these laws may interpreted and applied manner that inconsistent with our data practices. , addition the possibility fines, this could result order requiring that change our data practices, which could have adverse effect our business and results operations. Complying with these various laws could cause incur substantial costs require change our business practices manner adverse our business. Recent legal developments Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers information from Europe the . For example, the European Union and . Privacy Shield framework was designed allow for legal certainty regarding transfers data. However, the agreement itself faces number legal challenges Alphabet Inc. and subject annual review. This has resulted some uncertainty, and compliance obligations could cause incur costs require change our business practices manner adverse our business. our security measures are breached resulting the improper use and disclosure user data, our services are subject attacks that degrade deny the ability users access our products and services, our products and services may perceived not being secure, users and customers may curtail stop using our products and services, and may incur significant legal and financial exposure.

Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use our products, services, and technologies, result injunctions otherwise, which could result loss revenues and adversely impact our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered and our customers from covered products. Furthermore, connection with our divestitures, have agreed, and may the future agree, provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities. Regardless the merits the claims, intellectual property claims are often time consuming, expensive litigate settle, and cause significant diversion management attention. the extent such intellectual property infringement claims are successful, they may have adverse effect our business, consolidated financial position, results operations, cash flows.

Although seek obtain patent protection for our innovations, possible may not able protect some these innovations. Moreover, may not have adequate patent copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out important. Furthermore, there always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope the protection gained will insufficient that issued patent may deemed invalid unenforceable. also seek maintain certain intellectual property trade secrets. The secrecy could compromised outside parties, our employees, which could cause lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there risk that the word “Google” could become commonly used that becomes synonymous with the word “search.” this happens, could lose protection for this trademark, which could result other people using the word “Google” refer their own products, thus diminishing our brand. Any significant impairment our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights costly and time consuming.

For instance, the products sell may have quality issues resulting from the design manufacture the product, from the software used the product. Sometimes, these issues may caused components purchase from other manufacturers suppliers. the quality our products does not meet our customers' expectations our products are found defective, then our sales and operating earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could negatively impacted. rely third parties manufacture many our assemblies and finished products, and have third-party arrangements for the design some components and parts.

Additionally, because many our supply contracts have volume-based pricing minimum purchase requirements, the volume our hardware sales decreases does not reach projected targets, could face increased materials and manufacturing costs other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively impact our financial results. Further, certain our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may impact our supply. also require our suppliers and business partners comply with law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but not control them their practices. any them violates laws implements practices regarded unethical, could experience supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations damage key relationships, and damage our reputation. any them fails procure necessary license rights third-party intellectual property, legal action could ensue that could impact the saleability our products and expose financial obligations third parties. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes disclosure requirements regarding the use certain minerals mined from the Democratic Republic Congo and adjoining countries (DRC) and procedures pertaining manufacturer' efforts regarding the source such minerals. SEC rules implementing these requirements may have the effect reducing the pool suppliers who can supply DRC “conflict free” components and parts, and may not able obtain DRC conflict free products supplies sufficient quantities for our operations. Since our supply chain complex, may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders are unable sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals used our products. Web spam and content farms could decrease our search quality, which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services. “Web spam” refers websites that attempt violate search engine' quality guidelines that otherwise seek rank higher search results than search engine' assessment their relevance and utility would rank them. Alphabet Inc. Although English-language web spam our search results has been significantly reduced, and web spam most other languages limited, expect web spammers will continue seek ways improve their rankings inappropriately. continuously combat web spam, including through indexing technology that makes harder for spam-like, less useful web content rank highly. face challenges from low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including “content farms”, which are websites that generate large quantities low-quality content help them improve their search rankings. are continually launching algorithmic changes focused low-quality websites. our search results display increasing number web spam and content farms, this could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information reduce user traffic our websites. addition, continue take actions improve our search quality and reduce low-quality content, this may the short run reduce our AdSense revenues, since some these websites are AdSense partners. Interruption failure our information technology and communications systems could hurt our ability effectively provide our products and services, which could damage our reputation and harm our operating results. The availability our products and services depends the continuing operation our information technology and communications systems. Our systems are vulnerable damage interruption from earthquakes, terrorist attacks, natural disasters, the effects climate change (such sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased storm severity), power loss, telecommunications failures, computer viruses, computer denial service attacks, other attempts harm our systems. Some our data centers are located areas with high risk major earthquakes. Our data centers are also subject break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts vandalism, and potential disruptions the operators certain these facilities have financial difficulties. Some our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence natural disaster, decision close facility are using, other unanticipated problems our data centers could result lengthy interruptions our service. addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors vulnerabilities, which could result interruptions our services the failure our systems. Our international operations expose additional risks that could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Our international operations are significant our revenues and net income, and plan continue grow internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately % our consolidated revenues . certain international markets, have limited operating experience and may not benefit from any first- -market advantages otherwise succeed. addition risks described elsewhere this section, our international operations expose other risks, including the following: • Restrictions foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent from repatriating cash earned countries outside the . • Import and export requirements, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, and customs classifications that may prevent from offering products providing services particular market and may increase our operating costs. • Longer payment cycles some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels payment fraud. • Still developing foreign laws and legal systems. • Uncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty result local laws and lack legal precedent. • Different employee employer relationships, existence workers' councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused distance, language, and cultural differences, making harder business certain jurisdictions.

These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include, among others, internal control and disclosure rules, privacy and data protection requirements, anti-corruption laws, such the . Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting corrupt payments governmental officials, and competition regulations, among others. Violations these laws and regulations could result fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against , our officers, our employees, prohibitions the conduct our business and our ability offer our products and services one more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international growth efforts, our ability attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although have implemented policies and procedures designed ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can assurance that our employees, contractors, agents will not violate our policies. Alphabet Inc. Finally, since conduct business currencies other than . dollars but report our financial results . dollars, face exposure fluctuations currency exchange rates. Although hedge portion our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations exchange rates between the . dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenues and earnings. Additionally, hedging programs are inherently risky and could expose additional risks that could adversely affect our financial condition and results operations. Our operating results may fluctuate, which makes our results difficult predict and could cause our results fall short expectations. Our operating results may fluctuate result number factors, many outside our control. result, comparing our operating results period- -period basis may not meaningful, and you should not rely our past results indication our future performance. Our quarterly, year- -date, and annual expenses percentage our revenues may differ significantly from our historical projected rates. Our operating results future quarters may fall below expectations. Any these events could cause our stock price fall. Each the risk factors listed this section addition the following factors may affect our operating results: • Our ability continue attract users our websites and retain existing users our websites. • Our ability monetize ( generate revenues from) traffic Google properties and our Google Network Members' properties across various devices. • Advertising revenue fluctuations caused changes property mix, platform mix, device mix, and geographical mix. • The amount revenues and expenses generated and incurred currencies other than . dollars, and our ability manage the resulting risk through our foreign exchange risk management program. • The amount and timing operating costs and expenses and capital expenditures related the maintenance and expansion our businesses, operations, and infrastructure. • Our focus long-term goals over short-term results. • The results our acquisitions, divestitures, and our investments risky projects, including new businesses, products, services, and technologies. • Our ability keep our websites operational reasonable cost and without service interruptions. • Our ability generate significant revenues from new products and services which have invested considerable time and resources.

Our performance largely depends the talents and efforts highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends our continuing ability identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas our organization. Competition our industry for qualified employees intense, and certain our competitors have directly targeted our employees. addition, our compensation arrangements, such our equity award programs, may not always successful attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability compete effectively depends our ability attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees. addition, believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. our organization grows, and are required implement more complex organizational management structures, particularly light our holding company structure, may find increasingly difficult maintain the beneficial aspects our corporate culture. This could negatively impact our future success. Alphabet Inc. Our business depends continued and unimpeded access the Internet and our users. Internet access providers may able restrict, block, degrade, charge for access certain our products and services, which could lead additional expenses and the loss users and advertisers. Our products and services depend the ability our users access the Internet, and certain our products require significant bandwidth work effectively. Currently, this access provided companies that have significant market power the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some these providers have taken, have stated that they may take measures, including legal actions, that could degrade, disrupt, increase the cost user access certain our products restricting prohibiting the use their infrastructure support facilitate our offerings, charging increased fees our users provide our offerings. addition, some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject government-initiated restrictions blockages. Such interference could result loss existing users and advertisers, and increased costs, and could impair our ability attract new users and advertisers, thereby harming our revenues and growth. New and existing technologies could block ads online, which would harm our business. Technologies have been developed that can block the display ads online and that provide tools users opt out seeing ads online. Most our Google revenues are derived from fees paid connection with the display ads online. result, such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating results. are exposed fluctuations the market values our investments. Given the global nature our business, have investments both domestically and internationally. Credit ratings and market values these investments can negatively impacted liquidity, credit deterioration losses, financial results, foreign exchange rates, changes interest rates, other factors. result, the value liquidity our cash equivalents and marketable securities could decline and result material impairment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. could subject changes tax rates, the adoption new . international tax legislation, exposure additional tax liabilities.

Any adverse outcome such review audit could have negative effect our operating results and financial condition. addition, the determination our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination uncertain. Although believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results the period periods for which such determination made. Risks Related Ownership Our Stock The trading price for our Class common stock and non-voting Class capital stock may continue volatile. The trading price our stock has times experienced substantial price volatility and may continue volatile. For example, from January , through December , , the closing price our Class common stock ranged from $ per share $ per share, and the closing price our Class capital stock ranged from $ $ per share. addition the factors discussed this Annual Report Form - , the trading price our Class common stock and Class capital stock may fluctuate widely response various factors, many which are beyond our control, including, among others: • Quarterly variations our results operations those our competitors. • Announcements our competitors acquisitions, divestitures, investments, new products, significant contracts, commercial relationships, capital commitments. • Recommendations securities analysts changes earnings estimates. Alphabet Inc. • Announcements about our earnings that are not line with analyst expectations, the risk which enhanced because our policy not give guidance earnings. • Announcements our competitors their earnings that are not line with analyst expectations. • Commentary industry and market professionals about our products, strategies, and other matters affecting our business and results, regardless its accuracy. • The volume shares Class common stock and Class capital stock available for public sale. • Sales Class common stock and Class capital stock our stockholders (including sales our directors, executive officers, and other employees). • Short sales, hedging, and other derivative transactions shares our Class common stock and Class capital stock. • The perceived values Class common stock and Class capital stock relative one another. • Our stock repurchase program. addition, the stock market general, and the market for technology companies particular, have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated disproportionate the operating performance those companies.

These provisions include the following: • Our certificate incorporation provides for tri-class capital stock structure. result this structure, Larry, Sergey, and Eric have significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval, including the election directors and significant corporate transactions, such merger other sale our company our assets. This concentrated control could discourage others from initiating any potential merger, takeover, other change control transaction that other stockholders may view beneficial. noted above, the issuance the Class capital stock could have the effect prolonging the influence Larry, Sergey, and Eric. • Our board directors has the right elect directors fill vacancy created the expansion the board directors the resignation, death, removal director, which prevents stockholders from being able fill vacancies our board directors. Alphabet Inc. • Our stockholders may not act written consent. result, holder, holders, controlling majority our capital stock would not able take certain actions without holding stockholders' meeting. • Our certificate incorporation prohibits cumulative voting the election directors. This limits the ability minority stockholders elect director candidates. • Stockholders must provide advance notice nominate individuals for election the board directors propose matters that can acted upon stockholders’ meeting. These provisions may discourage deter potential acquirer from conducting solicitation proxies elect the acquirer' own slate directors otherwise attempting obtain control our company. • Our board directors may issue, without stockholder approval, shares undesignated preferred stock. The ability issue undesignated preferred stock makes possible for our board directors issue preferred stock with voting other rights preferences that could impede the success any attempt acquire .

Performance advertising creates and delivers relevant ads that users will click, leading direct engagement with advertisers. Brand advertising enhances users’ awareness and affinity with advertisers’ products and services, through videos, text, images, and other ads that run across various devices. Google properties revenues consist primarily advertising revenues generated Google com, the Google app, YouTube, and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Maps and Google Play. Google Network Members’ properties revenues consist primarily revenues generated from placing ads Google Network Members’ Alphabet Inc. properties. Our customers generally purchase ads through AdWords, DoubleClick Bid Manager, and DoubleClick AdExchange, among others. Most our customers pay cost-per-click basis, which means that advertiser pays only when user engages with the ads clicking Google properties Google Network Members\' properties viewing YouTube engagement ads like TrueView (counted engagement when the user chooses not skip the ). also offer advertising other bases such cost-per-impression, which enables our brand advertisers pay based the number times their ads are displayed Google properties and Google Network Members’ properties. Revenue from advertising recognized when the goods services have been delivered provided, the amounts charge are fixed determinable, and our advertisers other customers understand the specific nature and terms the agreed upon transactions, and collectability reasonably assured. recognize revenues the amounts charged advertisers each time user engages with ads that appears next the search results content Google properties Google Network Members’ properties. For those advertisers using our cost-per-impression pricing, recognize revenues the amounts charged advertisers each time their ads are displayed Google properties Google Network Members’ properties. generally report revenues from ads placed Google Network Members\' properties gross basis principally because are the primary obligor our advertisers. Revenue from hardware sales end customers through distribution channels generally recognized when the product has been shipped, risk loss has transferred the customer, objective evidence exists that customer acceptance provisions have been met, significant obligations remain and allowances for discounts, price protection, returns and customer incentives, applicable, can reasonably and reliably estimated. Revenues are reported net these allowances. For the sale certain third-party products and services, evaluate whether appropriate recognize revenue based the gross amount billed the customers the net amount earned revenue share. Generally, when record revenue gross basis, are the primary obligor transaction, and have also considered other factors, including whether are subject inventory risk have latitude establishing prices. For multi-element arrangements, including those that contain software essential hardware products’ functionality and services, allocate revenue each unit accounting based their relative selling prices. such circumstances, use hierarchy determine the selling prices used for allocating revenue: ( ) vendor-specific objective evidence fair value (VSOE), ( ) third-party evidence selling price, and (iii) best estimate the selling price (ESP). VSOE generally exists only when sell the deliverable separately and the price actually charged for that deliverable. ESPs reflect our best estimates what the selling price the deliverable would was sold regularly stand-alone basis. record deferred revenues when cash payments are received advance our performance the underlying agreement the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. Cost Revenues Cost revenues consists traffic acquisition costs which are \u200bpaid Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed their properties and amounts paid our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. Additionally, other costs revenues include the following: • The expenses associated with the operation our data centers (including depreciation, labor, energy, and bandwidth costs); • Content acquisition costs primarily related payments certain content providers from whom license their video and other content for distribution YouTube and Google Play ( pay fees these content providers based revenues generated flat fee); • Credit card and other transaction fees related processing customer transactions; • Stock-based compensation expense; • Inventory related costs for hardware sell; and • Amortization certain intangible assets. Stock-based Compensation Stock-based compensation includes restricted stock units (RSUs) that will settled Alphabet stock well awards expect ultimately settle cash. RSUs are measured the fair market value the underlying stock the grant date. Liability classified awards are remeasured fair value through settlement. recognize stock- Alphabet Inc. based compensation using the straight-line method over the requisite service period. With the adoption ASU - January , , account for forfeitures they occur. For RSUs, shares are issued the vesting dates net the minimum statutory tax withholding paid behalf our employees. result, the actual number shares issued will fewer than the actual number RSUs outstanding. record liability for withholding amounts paid primarily reduction additional paid- capital. Certain Risks and Concentrations Our revenues are primarily derived from online advertising, the market for which highly competitive and rapidly changing. addition, our revenues are generated from multitude vertical market segments countries around the world. Significant changes this industry changes customer buying advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results. are subject concentrations credit risk principally from cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid debt instruments the . government and its agencies, debt instruments issued foreign governments, debt instruments issued municipalities the ., corporate debt securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing. Accounts receivable are typically unsecured and are derived from revenues earned from customers located around the world. , , and , generated approximately % , % , and % our revenues from customers based the ., with the majority revenues from customers outside the . located Europe and Japan. perform ongoing evaluations determine customer credit and limit the amount credit extend, but generally not require collateral from our customers. maintain reserves for estimated credit losses and these losses have generally been within our expectations. individual customer groups affiliated customers represented more than % our revenues , , . Fair Value Financial Instruments Our financial assets and financial liabilities including cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts, and non-marketable debt securities are measured and recorded fair value recurring basis. measure certain financial assets fair value for disclosure purposes, well nonrecurring basis when they are deemed other-than-temporarily impaired. Our other current financial assets and our other current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying value. Fair value exit price, representing the amount that would received sell asset paid transfer liability orderly transaction between market participants. such, fair value market-based measurement that determined based assumptions that market participants would use pricing asset liability. Assets and liabilities recorded fair value are measured and classified accordance with three-tier fair value hierarchy based the observability the inputs available the market used measure fair value: Level - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets liabilities active markets. Level - Include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments active markets, quoted prices for identical similar instruments markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable the market can derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings. Level - Unobservable inputs that are supported little market activities. The fair value hierarchy requires entity maximize the use observable inputs and minimize the use unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities invest all excess cash primarily debt securities including those the . government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued foreign governments. Alphabet Inc. classify all investments that are readily convertible known amounts cash and have stated maturities three months less from the date purchase cash equivalents and those with stated maturities greater than three months marketable securities. determine the appropriate classification our investments marketable securities the time purchase and reevaluate such designation each balance sheet date. have classified and accounted for our marketable securities available-for-sale. After consideration our risk versus reward objectives, well our liquidity requirements, may sell these securities prior their stated maturities. view these securities available support current operations, classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond months current assets under the caption marketable securities the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheets. carry these securities fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net taxes, component stockholders’ equity, except for unrealized losses determined other-than-temporary, which record within other income (expense), net. determine any realized gains losses the sale marketable securities specific identification method, and record such gains and losses component other income (expense), net. Non-Marketable Investments have accounted for non-marketable equity investments either under the equity cost method. Investments through which exercise significant influence but not have control over the investee are accounted for under the equity method. Investments through which are not able exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the cost method. have accounted for our non-marketable investments that meet the definition debt security available-for-sale securities. Since these securities not have contractual maturity dates and not intend liquidate them the next months, have classified them non-current assets the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Variable Interest Entities make determination the inception each arrangement whether entity which have made investment which have other variable interests considered Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). consolidate VIEs when are deemed the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary VIE the party that meets both the following criteria: ( ) has the power make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance the VIE; and ( ) has the obligation absorb losses the right receive benefits that either case could potentially significant the VIE. Periodically, determine whether any changes occurred requiring reassessment whether are the primary beneficiary VIE. are not deemed the primary beneficiary VIE, account for the investment other variable interests VIE accordance with applicable GAAP. Impairment Marketable and Non-Marketable Investments periodically review our marketable and non-marketable investments for impairment. conclude that any these investments are impaired, determine whether such impairment other-than-temporary. Factors consider make such determination include the duration and severity the impairment, the reason for the decline value and the potential recovery period and our intent sell. For debt securities, also consider whether ( ) more likely than not that will required sell the security before recovery its amortized cost basis, and ( ) the amortized cost basis cannot recovered result credit losses. any impairment considered other-than-temporary, will write down the asset its fair value and record the corresponding charge other income (expense), net. Accounts Receivable record accounts receivable the invoiced amount and normally not charge interest. maintain allowance for doubtful accounts reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. review the accounts receivable amounts due customers which are past due identify specific customers with known disputes collectability issues. determining the amount the reserve, make judgments about the creditworthiness significant customers based ongoing credit evaluations. also maintain sales allowance reserve for potential credits issued customers. determine the amount the reserve based historical credits issued. Property and Equipment account for property and equipment cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives the assets. depreciate buildings over periods years. generally depreciate information technology assets over periods years. amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter the remaining lease term the estimated useful lives the assets. Construction progress the construction development property and equipment that have not yet been placed Alphabet Inc. service for our intended use. Depreciation for equipment commences once placed service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use. Land not depreciated. Inventory Inventory consists primarily finished goods and stated the lower cost and net realizable value. Cost computed using the first- , first-out method. Software Development Costs expense software development costs, including costs develop software products the software component products sold, leased, marketed external users, before technological feasibility reached. Technological feasibility typically reached shortly before the release such products and result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented. Software development costs also include costs develop software used solely meet internal needs and cloud based applications used deliver our services. capitalize development costs related these software applications once the preliminary project stage complete and probable that the project will completed and the software will used perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented. Business Combinations include the results operations the businesses that acquire the acquisition date. allocate the purchase price our acquisitions the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based their estimated fair values. The excess the purchase price over the fair values these identifiable assets and liabilities recorded goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed incurred. Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets review property and equipment, long-term prepayments and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment whenever events changes circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not recoverable. measure recoverability these assets comparing the carrying amounts the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets the asset group are expected generate. the carrying value the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized measured the amount which the carrying value the asset exceeds its fair market value. , recorded impairments intangible assets, including impairment $ million the third quarter related patent licensing royalty asset. Impairments intangible assets were not material . allocate goodwill reporting units based the reporting unit expected benefit from the business combination. evaluate our reporting units when changes our operating structure occur, and necessary, reassign goodwill using relative fair value allocation approach. test our goodwill for impairment least annually, more frequently events changes circumstances indicate that the asset may impaired. goodwill impairment has been identified any the years presented. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. amortize intangible assets straight-line basis with definite lives over periods ranging from one twelve years. Income Taxes account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which recognize the amount taxes payable refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences events that have been recognized our financial statements tax returns. measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based provisions enacted tax law. evaluate the realization our deferred tax assets based all available evidence and establish valuation allowance reduce deferred tax assets when more-likely-than-not that they will not realized. recognize the financial statement effects tax position when more-likely-than not that, based technical merits, the position will sustained upon examination. The tax benefits the position recognized the financial statements are then measured based the largest amount benefit that greater than % likely realized upon settlement with taxing authority. addition, recognize interest and penalties related unrecognized tax benefits component the income tax provision.

Net Income Per Share compute net income per share Class and Class common stock and Class capital stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share computed using the weighted-average number common shares outstanding during the period.

Potentially dilutive securities consist stock options, restricted stock units, and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, and other contingently issuable shares reflected diluted earnings per share application the treasury stock method.
