PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The PC software industry is characterized by extremely rapid technological change, which requires constant attention to software technology trends and shifting consumer demand, and rapid product innovation. The pace of change has recently become even greater due to the surge of interest in the Internet, other forms of online services, PC server-based networking, and new programming languages, such as Java. Most of the Company's software products are developed internally. The Company also purchases technology, licenses intellectual property rights, and oversees third-party development and localization of certain products. Internal development enables Microsoft to maintain closer technical control over the products and gives the Company the freedom to designate which modifications and enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented. The Company has created a substantial body of proprietary development tools and has evolved development methodologies for creating and enhancing its products. These tools and methodologies are also designed to simplify a product's portability among different operating systems, microprocessors, or computers. Product documentation is generally created internally. The Company believes that a crucial factor in the success of a new product is getting it to market quickly to respond to new user needs or advances in PCs, servers, peripherals, and the Internet, without compromising product quality. The Company strives to become informed at the earliest possible time about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may affect software design. During fiscal years 1995, 1996, and 1997, the Company spent $860 million, $1.43 billion, and $1.93 billion, respectively, on product research and development activities. Those amounts represented 14.5%, 16.5%, and 16.9%, respectively, of revenue in each of those years excluding funding of joint venture activity. The Company is committed to continue high expenditures for research and product development. LOCALIZATION - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- In order to best serve the needs of users in foreign countries, Microsoft "localizes" many of its products to reflect local languages and conventions. In French versions, for example, all user messages and documentation are in French and all monetary references are in French francs. Various Microsoft products have been localized into more than 30 languages. MANUFACTURING - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Microsoft contracts most of its manufacturing activity to third parties. Outside manufacturers produce various retail software packaged products, documentation, and hardware such as mouse pointing devices, keyboards, and joysticks. There are other custom manufacturers in the event that outsourced manufacturing becomes unavailable from current sources. In recent years the Company's sales mix has shifted to OEM and corporate and organizational licenses from packaged products. Online distribution of software may increase in the future. During July 1996, Microsoft sold its domestic manufacturing and distribution operation. The Company's remaining manufacturing facilities are located in Puerto Rico and Ireland. The Irish manufacturing facility replicates disks, assembles other purchased parts, and packages final product. The Puerto Rico facility manufactures CD-ROMs, assembles other purchased parts, and packages final product. Quality control tests are performed on purchased parts, finished disks and CD-ROMs, and other products. The chief materials and components used in Microsoft products include disks or CD-ROMs, books, and multicolor printed materials. The Company is often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount basis. The Company has multiple sources for raw materials, supplies, and components. MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Microsoft aligns its sales and marketing staff with several customer types, including OEMs, end-users, organizations, enterprises, applications developers, and Internet content providers (ICPs) and infrastructure owners. The Company's sales and marketing group seeks to build long-term relationships with customers of Microsoft products. In addition to the OEM channel, Microsoft has three major geographic sales and marketing organizations: the U.S. and Canada, Europe, and elsewhere in the world (Other International). The OEM customer unit includes the sales force which works with original equipment manufacturers that preinstall Microsoft software on their PCs. The end-user customer unit has responsibility for activities that target end-users that make individual buying decisions for the PCs they use at work or home. Most sales and marketing activities aimed at end-user customers are performed by this unit, including developing and administering reseller relationships; reseller sales terms and conditions; channel marketing and promotions; end-user marketing programs; support policies; and seminars, events, and sales training for resellers. The key products marketed by the end-user customer unit are the Company's desktop operating systems, desktop applications, and interactive media products. The organization customer unit has responsibility for activities that target groups of users in small and medium organizations. The unit works with channel partners such as distributors, aggregators, value-added resellers, and Solution Providers to provide complete business solutions to this customer segment. The unit's sales and marketing activities include providing technical training to Solution Providers (described below) and channel resellers; developing support policies; and supporting and providing seminars, events, and sales training for channel partners. The enterprise customer unit has responsibility for sales and marketing activities that target large organizations. The unit works directly with these organizations, and through large account resellers, to create and support enterprisewide, mission critical solutions for business computing needs. The applications developer customer unit targets corporate developers and independent software vendors (ISVs) who build business applications with a development platform based on Microsoft Windows and BackOffice architecture. The unit's sales and marketing activities include providing industry specific technical training, seminars, and events for ISVs. The Internet customer unit is responsible for introducing the Company's products and technologies to the public infrastructure owners and ICPs. Infrastructure owners include network operators (telephone companies, cable companies, Internet service providers, etc.) who build, own, and operate the public networks and ICPs who provide content for the Web. FINISHED GOODS CHANNELS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS. The Company markets its products in the finished goods channels primarily through independent non-exclusive distributors and resellers. Distributors include CHS Electronics, Computer 2000, Ingram Micro, Softbank, Tech Data, and Merisel. Resellers include Software Spectrum and Stream International.

The Microsoft Select program offers flexible software acquisition, licensing, and maintenance options specially customized to meet the needs of large multinational organizations. Targeted audiences include technology specialists and influential end-users in large enterprises. Marketing efforts and fulfillment are generally coordinated with the Microsoft network of large account resellers. SOLUTION PROVIDERS. Microsoft's Solution Providers program is a comprehensive support relationship with independent organizations that provide network and system integration, custom development, training, and technical support for business computing solutions. The program supports value-added resellers (VARs), system integrators, consultants, custom application developers, solution developers, Internet service and hosting organizations, independent content providers, and sitebuilders (companies that build Web sites for other companies), as well as technical support and training organizations. Under this business partnership strategy, the Company provides sales and product information, development services, early access to Microsoft products, and customer support tools including priority telephone support, education, and business development support. To ensure high-quality technical services for the Company's products, Microsoft Solution Providers are required to have Microsoft-certified professionals on staff. CONSULTING SERVICES. The Company's Consulting Services Division assists customers in using the Company's computer operating systems, applications, and communications products. The group works with Solution Providers and helps create enterprisewide computing solutions for large corporate accounts. INTERNATIONAL SALES SITES. The Company has established marketing and/or support subsidiaries in more than 60 countries. Product is generally delivered by the Company's owned or outsourced manufacturing operations. The Company's international operations, both OEM and finished goods, are subject to certain risks common to foreign operations in general, such as governmental regulations, import restrictions, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations. Microsoft hedges a portion of its foreign exchange risk. OEM CHANNEL - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Microsoft operating systems are licensed primarily to OEMs under agreements that grant the OEMs the right to distribute copies of the Company's products with their computers. The Company also markets certain desktop applications and interactive media programs to OEMs under similar arrangements. In addition, the Company markets the Microsoft Mouse and Natural Keyboard to OEMs for distribution to buyers of their computers. In almost all cases, the products are distributed under Microsoft trademarks. The Company has OEM agreements covering one or more of its products with virtually all of the major PC OEMs, including AST Research, Acer, Compaq, Digital Equipment Corporation, Dell, Fujitsu, Gateway 2000, Hewlett-Packard, IBM, NEC, Packard Bell, Siemens, Toshiba, and Vobis. ADVERTISING - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Company works closely with large advertising and direct marketing firms. Advertising, direct marketing, worldwide packaging, and marketing materials are targeted to various end-user segments. The Company utilizes broad consumer media (television, radio, and business publications) and trade publications. Microsoft has programs under which qualifying resellers and OEMs are reimbursed for certain advertising expenditures. The Company maintains a broad advertising campaign emphasizing the Microsoft brand identity. CUSTOMERS - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Company's customers include end-users, organizations, enterprises, ISPs, application developers, and OEMs. Most end-users of Microsoft products are individuals in businesses, government agencies, educational institutions, and at home. These end-users obtain Microsoft products primarily through distributors, resellers, and OEMs, which include certain Microsoft products with their hardware. Notes to Financial Statements (see Item 8) describe customers that represent more than 10% of the Company's revenue. The Company's practice is to ship its products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from its customers and, consequently, backlog is not significant. PRODUCT SUPPORT - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The Company provides product support coverage options to meet the needs of users of Microsoft products. Support personnel are located in various sites in the U.S. and around the world. Certain support is also supplied by qualified third-party support organizations. The Company hires individuals with product expertise and provides them with productivity tools, continuous product education and training, and consistent processes to deliver quality support for Microsoft products. Coverage options range from standard no-charge toll telephone support to fee-based offerings providing unlimited 800 number telephone and electronic technical support for all Microsoft products 24 hours per day, 7 days per week. Users have access to troubleshooting "wizards" and Microsoft's KnowledgeBase, a library of thousands of technical articles that is updated regularly with useful information regarding Microsoft products. Microsoft provides access to KnowledgeBase via MSN, America Online, CompuServe, Prodigy, and the Internet. Additionally, several support offerings include Microsoft TechNet and Microsoft Developer Network information subscription services. As a supplement or alternative to direct support, the Company enhances the third-party support channel by providing Microsoft Solution Providers with education, training, tools, and support. Microsoft Solution Providers include Authorized Training Centers, which offer advanced product education and certification on Microsoft products; and Authorized Support Centers, which provide a wide spectrum of multinational support, multivendor support, and integration services. COMPETITION - -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- The PC software business is intensely competitive and subject to extremely rapid technological change. Microsoft faces formidable competition in all areas of its business activity, including competition from many companies much larger than Microsoft. The rapid pace of technological change constantly creates new opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups and can quickly render existing technologies less valuable. The Company also faces constant competition from software pirates who unlawfully copy and distribute Microsoft's copyrighted software products. OPERATING SYSTEMS. Microsoft's operating system products face substantial competition from a wide variety of companies. Major competitors such as IBM, Apple Computer, Digital Equipment Corporation, Hewlett-Packard, Sun Microsystems, and others are vertically integrated in both software development and hardware manufacturing and have developed operating systems that they preinstall on computers of their own manufacture. Many of these operating system software products are also licensed to third-party OEMs for preinstallation on their machines. Microsoft's operating system products compete with UNIX-based operating systems from a wide range of companies including IBM, AT&T, Hewlett- Packard, Sun, The Santa Cruz Operation, and others. Variants of UNIX run on a wide variety of computer platforms and have gained increasing acceptance as desktop operating systems. As PC technology increasingly moves toward connectivity and communications, Microsoft's operating system products will face increased competition from network server operating systems such as Novell's NetWare, Banyan's Vines, the many variants of UNIX, IBM's OS/2, "middleware" products such as IBM's Lotus Notes, and intranet servers from Netscape, IBM, Sun, and others. BUSINESS SYSTEMS. The Company is a fairly recent entrant into the business of providing enterprisewide computing solutions. Several competitors enjoy a larger share of sales and larger installed bases. Many companies offer operating system software for mainframes and midrange computers, including IBM, Digital Equipment, Hewlett-Packard, and Sun. Since legacy business systems are typically support-intensive, these competitors also offer substantive support services. Software developers that provide competing server applications for PC-based distributed client/server environments include Oracle, IBM, Computer Associates, Sybase, and Informix. There are also several software vendors who offer connectivity servers. As mentioned above, there are numerous companies and organizations that offer Internet and intranet server software which compete against the Company's business systems. Additionally, IBM has a large installed base of Lotus Notes and cc:Mail, both of which compete with the Company's workgroup and mail products. DESKTOP APPLICATIONS. The Company's competitors include many software application vendors, such as IBM (Lotus), Oracle, Apple (Claris), Corel, and local application developers in Europe and the Far East. IBM and Corel have large installed bases with their spreadsheet and word processor products, respectively, and both have aggressive pricing strategies. Also, IBM and Apple preinstall certain of their software products on various models of their PCs, competing directly with Microsoft desktop application software. DEVELOPER TOOLS. The Company's developer products compete against offerings from Borland, Macromedia, Oracle, Sun, Sybase, Symantec, and other companies. NEWS SERVICES. The Company's MSNBC joint ventures face formidable competition from other 24-hour cable and Internet news organizations such as CNN and Fox News Network. MSNBC also competes with traditional news media such as newspapers and broadcast TV and Internet news services. CONSUMER PLATFORMS. A wide variety of companies develop operating systems for information appliances, including Apple, Motorola, 3Com, Psion Software, and others. The Company's nascent WebTV offerings and other multimedia consumer products face competitors such as Sun, Oracle, NetChannel, and others. An enormous range of companies, including media conglomerates, telephone companies, cable companies, retailers, hardware manufacturers, and software developers, are competing to make interactive services widely available to the home. INTERNET PLATFORMS AND SERVICES. The advent of the Internet as a computing, communication, and collaboration platform as well as a low cost and efficient distribution vehicle increases competition and creates uncertainty as to future technology directions. The Company faces intense competition in the development and marketing of Internet (and intranet) software from a wide variety of companies and organizations including IBM, Netscape, Novell, Oracle, Sun, and many others. In addition, the very low barriers to entry on the Internet have allowed numerous Web-based service companies to build significant businesses in areas such as electronic mail, electronic commerce, Web search engines, and information of numerous types. Competitors include Netscape, Lycos, Yahoo, Excite, Infoseek, CitySearch, and many others. ONLINE SERVICES. Microsoft's online services network, MSN, faces formidable competition from America Online and other online networks, such as CompuServe (the sale of which to America Online is pending), Prodigy, and impending entrants. Additionally, MSN faces competition from online services that are offered to users directly via the World Wide Web. INTERACTIVE MEDIA. The Company's Interactive Media division faces many smaller but focused and branded competitors, particularly in the areas of entertainment and education. Consolidation in this area of software development has made certain competitors even stronger. Competitors include Intuit, Broderbund, Electronic Arts, The Learning Company (including Softkey, MECC, and Compton's), Voyager, CUC International (including Sierra On Line, Knowledge Adventures, and Davidson Associates), and Dorling Kindersley. Still other competitors own branded content, such as Disney and Lucas Arts. Additionally, PC-based games are increasingly competing head-to-head against games created for proprietary systems such as Nintendo, Sony PlayStation, and Sega. Input devices face substantial competition from computer manufacturers, since computers are typically sold with a keyboard and mouse, and other manufacturers of these devices. A number of Microsoft's most significant competitors, including IBM, Sun, Oracle, and Netscape, have jointly embarked upon various technology development and marketing initiatives that are intended to increase customer demand for products from these companies. These initiatives relate in part to efforts to move software from individual PCs to centrally-managed servers. While the likely technological and business success of such "thin client" strategies is currently unknown, widespread adoption of such computing systems would present significant challenges to the Company's historical business model. The Company's competitive position may be adversely affected by one or more of these factors in the future, particularly in view of the fast pace of technological change in the software industry. EMPLOYEES - ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- As of June 30, 1997, the Company employed 22,232 people on a full-time basis, 15,835 in the U.S. and 6,397 internationally. Of the total, 8,059 were in product research and development, 11,074 in sales, marketing, and support, 1,115 in manufacturing and distribution, and 1,984 in finance and administration. Microsoft's success is highly dependent on its ability to attract and retain qualified employees. Competition for employees is intense in the software industry. To date, the Company believes it has been successful in its efforts to recruit qualified employees, but there is no assurance that it will continue to be as successful in the future. None of the Company's employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements. The Company believes relations with its employees are excellent. Item 2. Properties The Company's corporate offices consist of approximately 3.6 million square feet of office building space located in King County, Washington. There are two sites that total approximately 300 acres of land. The Company is constructing three office buildings comprising approximately 565,000 square feet of space. Occupancy on this site will be phased starting in the winter of 1997 and completed by spring of 1998. Additionally, construction is continuing on another set of office buildings with approximately 423,000 square feet of space. This site will be occupied in the winter of 1999. The Company owns all of its corporate campus. The Company leases a 45,000 square foot disk duplication facility in Humacao, Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico facility, which began operation in April 1990, is leased under a 10-year lease, with an option to renew for an additional 10 years. The Company's European manufacturing operation consists of a 161,000 square foot facility situated on 12 acres in Dublin, Ireland. The Ireland site also includes office buildings with 157,000 square feet for international localization. The Ireland facilities are fully owned by the Company. In Les Ulis, France, the Company owns a 199,000 square foot office building on four acres of land. The Company is constructing an office building complex with 225,000 square feet on 33 acres of land near Redding, England. This is a phased construction project, occupancy is expected to begin in the fall of 1997 and be completed in winter of 1997. In addition, the Company leases office space in numerous locations in the United States and many other countries. Item 3.
