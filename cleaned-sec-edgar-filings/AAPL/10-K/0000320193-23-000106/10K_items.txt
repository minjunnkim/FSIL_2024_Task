The impact can particularly significant these restrictive measures apply countries and regions where the Company derives significant portion its revenues and has significant supply chain operations. Restrictive measures can require the Company take various actions, including changing suppliers, restructuring business relationships, and ceasing offer third-party applications its platforms. Changing the Company’ operations accordance with new changed restrictions international trade can expensive, time-consuming and disruptive the Company’ operations. Such restrictions can announced with little advance notice and the Company may not able effectively mitigate all adverse impacts from such measures. For example, tensions between governments, including the . and China, have the past led tariffs and other restrictions being imposed the Company’ business. disputes and conflicts further escalate the future, actions governments response could significantly more severe and restrictive and could materially adversely affect the Company’ business. Political uncertainty surrounding trade and other international disputes could also have negative effect consumer confidence and spending, which could adversely affect the Company’ business. Many the Company’ operations and facilities, well critical business operations the Company’ suppliers and contract manufacturers, are locations that are prone earthquakes and other natural disasters. addition, such operations and facilities are subject the risk interruption fire, power shortages, nuclear power plant accidents and other industrial accidents, terrorist attacks and other hostile acts, ransomware and other cybersecurity attacks, labor disputes, public health issues, including pandemics such the COVID- pandemic, and other events beyond the Company’ control. Global climate change resulting certain types natural disasters, such droughts, floods, hurricanes and wildfires, occurring more frequently with more intense effects.

There can assurance the Company will able continue provide products and services that compete effectively. Business Risks remain competitive and stimulate customer demand, the Company must successfully manage frequent introductions and transitions products and services. Due the highly volatile and competitive nature the markets and industries which the Company competes, the Company must continually introduce new products, services and technologies, enhance existing products and services, effectively stimulate customer demand for new and upgraded products and services, and successfully manage the transition these new and upgraded products and services. The success new product and service introductions depends number factors, including timely and successful development, market acceptance, the Company’ ability manage the risks associated with new technologies and production ramp- issues, the availability application software for the Company’ products, the effective management purchase commitments and inventory levels line with anticipated product demand, the availability products appropriate quantities and expected costs meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products and services may have quality other defects deficiencies. There can assurance the Company will successfully manage future introductions and transitions products and services. The Company depends component and product manufacturing and logistical services provided outsourcing partners, many which are located outside the . Substantially all the Company’ manufacturing performed whole part outsourcing partners located primarily China mainland, India, Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam, and significant concentration this manufacturing currently performed small number outsourcing partners, often single locations. Changes additions the Company’ supply chain require considerable time and resources and involve significant risks and uncertainties. The Company has also outsourced much its transportation and logistics management. While these arrangements can lower operating costs, they also reduce the Company’ direct control over production and distribution. Such diminished control has from time time and may the future have adverse effect the quality quantity products manufactured services provided, adversely affect the Company’ flexibility respond changing conditions. Although arrangements with these partners may contain provisions for product defect expense reimbursement, the Company generally remains responsible the consumer for warranty and out- -warranty service the event product defects and experiences unanticipated product defect liabilities from time time. While the Company relies its partners adhere its supplier code conduct, violations the supplier code conduct occur from time time and can materially adversely affect the Company’ business, reputation, results operations and financial condition.

The Company has invested manufacturing process equipment, much which held certain its outsourcing partners, and has made prepayments certain its suppliers associated with long-term supply agreements. While these arrangements help ensure the supply components and finished goods, these outsourcing partners suppliers experience severe financial problems other disruptions their business, such continued supply can reduced terminated, and the recoverability manufacturing process equipment prepayments can negatively impacted. Future operating results depend upon the Company’ ability obtain components sufficient quantities commercially reasonable terms. Because the Company currently obtains certain components from single limited sources, the Company subject significant supply and pricing risks. Many components, including those that are available from multiple sources, are times subject industry-wide shortages and significant commodity pricing fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the Company’ business, results operations and financial condition. For example, the global semiconductor industry has the past experienced high demand and shortages supply, which adversely affected the Company’ ability obtain sufficient quantities components and products commercially reasonable terms all. Such disruptions could occur the future. While the Company has entered into agreements for the supply many components, there can assurance the Company will able extend renew these agreements similar terms, all. Component suppliers may suffer from poor financial conditions, which can lead business failure for the supplier consolidation within particular industry, further limiting the Company’ ability obtain sufficient quantities components commercially reasonable terms all. The effects global regional economic conditions the Company’ suppliers, described “ The Company’ operations and performance depend significantly global and regional economic conditions and adverse economic conditions can materially adversely affect the Company’ business, results operations and financial condition, ” above, can also affect the Company’ ability obtain components . Therefore, the Company remains subject significant risks supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely affect its business, results operations and financial condition. The Company’ new products often utilize custom components available from only one source. When component product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued availability these components acceptable prices, all, can affected for any number reasons, including suppliers decide concentrate the production common components instead components customized meet the Company’ requirements. When the Company’ supply components for new existing product has been delayed constrained, when outsourcing partner has delayed shipments completed products the Company, the Company’ business, results operations and financial condition have been adversely affected and future delays constraints could materially adversely affect the Company’ business, results operations and financial condition. The Company’ business and financial performance could also materially adversely affected depending the time required obtain sufficient quantities from the source, identify and obtain sufficient quantities from alternative source. The Company’ products and services may affected from time time design and manufacturing defects that could materially adversely affect the Company’ business and result harm the Company’ reputation. The Company offers complex hardware and software products and services that can affected design and manufacturing defects. Sophisticated operating system software and applications, such those offered the Company, often have issues that can unexpectedly interfere with the intended operation hardware software products and services. Defects can also exist components and products the Company purchases from third parties. Component defects could make the Company’ products unsafe and create risk environmental property damage and personal injury. These risks may increase the Company’ products are introduced into specialized applications, including health. addition, the Company’ service offerings can have quality issues and from time time experience outages, service slowdowns errors. result, from time time the Company’ services have not performed anticipated and may not meet customer expectations. There can assurance the Company will able detect and fix all issues and defects the hardware, software and services offers. Failure can result widespread technical and performance issues affecting the Company’ products and services. addition, the Company can exposed product liability claims, recalls, product replacements modifications, write-offs inventory, property, plant and equipment intangible assets, and significant warranty and other expenses, including litigation costs and regulatory fines. Quality problems can also adversely affect the experience for users the Company’ products and services, and result harm the Company’ reputation, loss competitive advantage, poor market acceptance, reduced demand for products and services, delay new product and service introductions and lost sales. Apple Inc. | Form - | The Company exposed the risk write-downs the value its inventory and other assets, addition purchase commitment cancellation risk. The Company records write-down for product and component inventories that have become obsolete exceed anticipated demand, for which cost exceeds net realizable value. The Company also accrues necessary cancellation fee reserves for orders excess products and components. The Company reviews long-lived assets, including capital assets held its suppliers’ facilities and inventory prepayments, for impairment whenever events circumstances indicate the assets may not recoverable. the Company determines that impairment has occurred, records write-down equal the amount which the carrying value the asset exceeds its fair value. Although the Company believes its inventory, capital assets, inventory prepayments and other assets and purchase commitments are currently recoverable, there can assurance the Company will not incur write-downs, fees, impairments and other charges given the rapid and unpredictable pace product obsolescence the industries which the Company competes. The Company orders components for its products and builds inventory advance product announcements and shipments. Manufacturing purchase obligations cover the Company’ forecasted component and manufacturing requirements, typically for periods days. Because the Company’ markets are volatile, competitive and subject rapid technology and price changes, there risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and order produce excess insufficient amounts components products, not fully utilize firm purchase commitments. The Company relies access third-party intellectual property, which may not available the Company commercially reasonable terms all. The Company’ products and services are designed include intellectual property owned third parties, which requires licenses from those third parties. addition, because technological changes the industries which the Company currently competes the future may compete, current extensive patent coverage and the rapid rate issuance new patents, the Company’ products and services can unknowingly infringe existing patents intellectual property rights others. From time time, the Company has been notified that may infringing certain patents other intellectual property rights third parties. Based experience and industry practice, the Company believes licenses such third-party intellectual property can generally obtained commercially reasonable terms. However, there can assurance the necessary licenses can obtained commercially reasonable terms all.

There can assurance third-party developers will continue develop and maintain software applications and services for the Company’ products. third-party software applications and services cease developed and maintained for the Company’ products, customers may choose not buy the Company’ products. The Company believes the availability third-party software applications and services for its products depends part the developers’ perception and analysis the relative benefits developing, maintaining and upgrading such software and services for the Company’ products compared competitors’ platforms, such Android for smartphones and tablets, Windows for personal computers and tablets, and PlayStation, Nintendo and Xbox for gaming platforms. This analysis may based factors such the market position the Company and its products, the anticipated revenue that may generated, expected future growth product sales, and the costs developing such applications and services. The Company’ minority market share the global smartphone, personal computer and tablet markets can make developers less inclined develop upgrade software for the Company’ products and more inclined devote their resources developing and upgrading software for competitors’ products with larger market share. When developers focus their efforts these competing platforms, the availability and quality applications for the Company’ devices can suffer. The Company relies the continued availability and development compelling and innovative software applications for its products. The Company’ products and operating systems are subject rapid technological change, and when third-party developers are unable choose not keep with this pace change, their applications can fail take advantage these changes deliver improved customer experiences, can operate incorrectly, and can result dissatisfied customers and lower customer demand for the Company’ products.

Apple Inc. | Form - | Note – Revenue The Company recognizes revenue the amount which expects entitled when control the products services transferred its customers. Control generally transferred when the Company has present right payment and title and the significant risks and rewards ownership products services are transferred its customers. For most the Company’ Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’ Services net sales, control transfers over time services are delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales collected within short period following transfer control commencement delivery services, applicable. The Company records reductions Products net sales related future product returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based the Company’ expectations and historical experience. For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises within arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue all distinct performance obligations based their relative stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that reflect the Company’ best estimates what the selling prices the performance obligations would they were sold regularly stand-alone basis. The Company’ process for estimating SSPs without observable prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related each performance obligation including, where applicable, prices charged the Company for similar offerings, market trends the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and the estimated cost provide the performance obligation. The Company has identified three performance obligations regularly included arrangements involving the sale iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion the allocated sales price, the hardware and bundled software delivered the time sale. The second performance obligation the right receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud ® , Siri ® and Maps. The third performance obligation the right receive, when-and- -available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts these performance obligations based their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance obligations, the allocation revenue based the Company’ estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated the delivered hardware and bundled software recognized when control has transferred the customer, which generally occurs when the product shipped. Revenue allocated the product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights deferred and recognized straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected provided. For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance obligations for services has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the Company does not have right bill for the undelivered services. The Company has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely the value the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, and does not disclose amounts, related these undelivered services.

For third-party applications sold through the App Store, the Company does not obtain control the product before transferring the customer.
