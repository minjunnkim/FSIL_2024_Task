ITEM 1. BUSINESS GENERAL Apple Computer, Inc.-Registered Trademark- ("Apple" or the "Company") was incorporated under the laws of the state of California on January 3, 1977. The Company's principal executive offices are located at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino, California, 95014, and its telephone number is (408) 996-1010. The Company designs, manufactures and markets personal computers and related personal computing and communicating solutions for sale primarily to education, creative, consumer, and business customers. Substantially all of the Company's net sales to date have been derived from the sale of personal computers from its Apple Macintosh-Registered Trademark- line of computers and related software and peripherals. The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's geographic segments include the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The European segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan, while the Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and Asia except for Japan. Each geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Net Sales," and in Part II, Item 8 on this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9, "Segment Information and Geographic Data," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. During 1998, the Company continued and essentially completed a restructuring plan commenced in 1996 aimed at reducing its cost structure, improving its competitiveness, and restoring sustainable profitability. The Company's restructuring actions included the termination of employees, closure of facilities, and cancellation of contracts. Further information regarding these restructuring actions may be found in Part II, Item 8 on this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 4, "Special Charges," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. PRINCIPAL HARDWARE PRODUCTS Apple Macintosh personal computers were first introduced in 1984, and are characterized by their intuitive ease of use, innovative industrial designs and applications base, and built-in networking, graphics, and multimedia capabilities. The Company offers a wide range of personal computing products, including personal computers, related peripherals, software, and networking and connectivity products. All of the Company's Macintosh products employ PowerPC-Registered Trademark- RISC-based microprocessors. POWER MACINTOSH-Registered Trademark- The Power Macintosh line of high-performance personal computers is targeted at business and professional users and is designed to meet the speed, expansion and networking needs of the most demanding Macintosh user. The Company's current line of Power Macintosh systems was introduced in August 1999 and is equipped with PowerPC G4 processors. With the addition of Apple networking software, Power Macintosh systems can be used as workgroup servers. POWERBOOK-Registered Trademark- G3 The PowerBook G3 family of portable computer products is specifically designed to meet the mobile computing needs of professionals and advanced personal users. Incorporating powerful PowerPC G3 1 processors, large active-matrix displays, long battery lives, and software designed to enhance mobile computing, the Company's PowerBook G3 family is intended to provide professional desktop performance in a notebook computer. iMAC-Registered Trademark- Originally announced in May 1998, the iMac computer is targeted at the education and consumer markets. With an innovative industrial design, easy Internet access, and a powerful PowerPC G3 processor, iMac is suitable for a wide range of education and consumer applications. A completely redesigned iMac was introduced in October 1999 and is available in three models: iMac, iMac DV-Registered Trademark- (Digital Video), and iMac DV Special Edition. Both DV models feature Firewire ports, DVD drives, and the Company's simple-to-use iMovie-TM- digital video editing software. iBOOK-TM- The iBook computer, intended to be the "iMac to Go," was introduced in July 1999. Designed specifically for the portable computing needs of education and consumer users, the iBook features a large active-matrix display, long battery life, a PowerPC G3 processor, Internet-ready hardware and software configurations, and built-in antennas for optional AirPort-TM- wireless networking capability. PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS The Company sells certain associated computer peripherals, including a range of high quality precision color monitors and AirPort wireless networking base stations and add-in cards. Over the past three years, the Company eliminated all of its Apple-branded printers and significantly reduced the number of its monitor products. The Company also discontinued its MessagePad-Registered Trademark- and eMate-Registered Trademark- product lines. The discontinuance of these peripheral products and portable computing products was part of the overall strategy by the Company to simplify and focus its efforts on those products perceived as critical to the Company's future success. PRINCIPAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE The Company's operating system software, Mac-Registered Trademark- OS, provides Macintosh computers with an easy, consistent user interface. The current version, Mac OS 9-Registered Trademark-, began shipping in October 1999 and delivers Sherlock-TM- 2, the updated version of the Company's advanced Internet search engine. Mac OS 9 includes over 50 new features, including features for faster and more efficient Internet usage, enhanced system and network security, and auto-updating of Apple software over the Internet. The Company plans to continue to introduce upgrades to Mac OS 9 and later to introduce the client version of a new operating system, Mac OS X. Mac OS X Client is expected to offer advanced functionality based on software technologies of Apple and those in-process technologies of NeXT-Registered Trademark- Software, Inc. (NeXT), which the Company acquired in 1997. In March 1999, the Company introduced Mac OS X Server, which combines the strength of UNIX-Registered Trademark- and simplicity of the Macintosh. Mac OS X Server is based on the Mach 2.5 microkernel and the BSD-Registered Trademark- 4.4 operating system. It provides performance and stability through full preemptive multitasking, protected memory, and advanced virtual memory. NetBoot is a Mac OS X server feature allowing a network of Macs to be booted and configured from a single server. In March 1999, the Company also introduced Darwin, the Open Source release of the Mac OS X server foundation. The Company has two primary digital video authoring/editing software titles. Final Cut Pro-TM-, introduced in April 1999, is video authoring software that combines professional-quality video editing, compositing, and special effects in one package. iMovie, introduced in October 1999, makes it easy to create home and classroom movies. iMovie software comes pre-installed on all iMac DV and iMac DV Special Edition models. 2 The Company also develops and distributes extensions to the Macintosh system software, such as utilities, languages, and developer tools. The Company continues to develop QuickTime-Registered Trademark-, its market-leading cross platform digital media technology. WebObjects-Registered Trademark-, a leading software product in the emerging application server market, is also part of Apple's software portfolio. Targeted at Windows NT-Registered Trademark- and UNIX platforms, future versions will also run on Apple hardware. FileMaker-Registered Trademark- Corporation (formerly Claris-Registered Trademark- Corporation), a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, develops, publishes, and distributes database management application software for Mac OS and Windows-based systems. Further, the Company has developed and currently markets AppleWorks-Registered Trademark- 5, formerly ClarisWorks-Registered Trademark-, an integrated suite of software applications that combines word processing, database, spreadsheet, drawing and communications capabilities in a single software package for both Mac OS and Windows. INTERNET INTEGRATION Apple's Internet strategy is focused on delivering seamless integration with and access to the Internet throughout the Company's product lines. In addition to Sherlock 2, an easy Internet Setup Assistant is an integral part of Mac OS 9, the current version of the Macintosh operating system. THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS Over the past two years, particularly since the announcement of the iMac in May 1998, software developers have demonstrated renewed interest in the Macintosh platform. Since iMac was announced, approximately 5,000 new or revised software titles have been announced for the Macintosh platform. Additionally, Microsoft delivered a new version of their productivity software--Office 98: Macintosh Edition--in early 1998. The Company previously entered into agreements to license its Mac OS to other personal computer vendors (the Clone Vendors) as part of an effort to increase the installed base for the Macintosh platform. In fiscal 1997, the Company determined the benefits of licensing the Mac OS to the Clone Vendors under these agreements were more than offset by the impact and costs of the licensing program. As a result, the Company discontinued the Mac OS licensing program and acquired certain assets of Power Computing Corporation (PCC), a Clone Vendor, including PCC's license to distribute the Mac OS. The Company does not currently plan general licensing of the Mac OS. Further information regarding the Company's products may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading "Competition" included under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTION The Company's customers are primarily in the education, creative, consumer, and business markets. Certain customers are attracted to Macintosh computers for a variety of reasons, including the reduced amount of training resulting from the Macintosh computer's intuitive ease of use, industrial design features of the Company's hardware products, the ability of Macintosh computers to network and communicate with other computer systems and environments, and the availability of a wide variety of certain user-friendly application software. Apple personal computers were first introduced to education customers in the late 1970s. In the United States, the Company is one of the major suppliers of personal computers for both elementary and secondary school customers, as well as for college and university customers. The Company is also a supplier to institutions of higher education outside of the United States. The United States represents the Company's largest geographic marketplace. The United States is part of the Company's Americas operating segment, which has responsibility for the Company's sales, marketing, and support efforts in North and South America. Approximately 45% of the Company's net sales in fiscal 1999 came from its international operations. Final assembly of products sold by the Company is conducted 3 in the Company's manufacturing facilities in California, Singapore, and Cork, Ireland, and by external vendors in Taiwan, Korea, Mexico, and the United Kingdom. The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers, and directly to education institutions for resale (collectively referred to as "resellers"). The Company also sells many of its products in most of its major markets directly to end users through its on-line store. Throughout fiscal 1998, the Company revised its distribution channel model and related policies. As a result, the Company significantly reduced the number of its distributors, authorized resellers, and national retail channel partners, particularly in the United States. The Company also revised its distribution channel policies including decreasing the price protection and stock return privileges of its remaining distributors and resellers. RAW MATERIALS Although certain components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs)) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components (including without limitation DRAM and TFT-LCD flat-panel displays), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures. Any availability limitations, interruption in supplies, or price increases relative to these and other components could adversely affect the Company's business and financial results. In addition, new products introduced by the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there is a need for and subsequently qualifies additional suppliers. In situations where a component or product utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time as the suppliers' yields have matured. Components are normally acquired through purchase orders, as is common in the industry, typically covering the Company's requirements for periods from 60 to 120 days. However, the Company continues to evaluate the need for a supply contract in each situation. If the supply of a key component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipment of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. In addition to its current suppliers of DRAM and TFT-LCD flat-panel displays, the Company believes the component suppliers and manufacturing vendors whose loss to the Company could have a material adverse effect upon the Company's business and financial position include, at this time: Alpha-Top Corporation, Ambit Microsystems Corporation, ATI Technologies, Inc., Canon, Inc., Darfon Electronics Corporation, IBM Corporation, LG Electronics, Matsushita, Motorola, Inc., NatSteel Electronics PTE Ltd., Philips Semiconductors, Quanta Computer, Inc., and Samsung Electronics. The Company attempts to mitigate these potential risks by working closely with these and other key suppliers on product introduction plans, strategic inventories, coordinated product introductions, and internal and external manufacturing schedules and levels. The Company believes many of its single-source suppliers, including most of the foregoing companies, are reliable multinational corporations. The Company also believes most of these suppliers manufacture the relevant components in multiple plants. The Company further believes its long-standing business relationships with many of these and other key suppliers are strong and mutually beneficial in nature. The Company has from time to time experienced significant price increases and limited availability of certain components that are available from multiple sources. Any similar occurrences in the future could have an adverse effect on the Company's operating results. Further discussion relating to availability and supply of components and product may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading "Inventory and Supply" included under the heading 4 "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 8 under the subheading "Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND LICENSES The Company currently holds rights to patents and copyrights relating to certain aspects of its computer systems, peripheral systems, and software. In addition, the Company has registered, and/or has applied to register, trademarks in the United States and a number of foreign countries for "Apple-Registered Trademark-", the Apple silhouette logo, the Apple color logo, "Macintosh-Registered Trademark-," and numerous other product trademarks. In 1986, the Company acquired ownership of the trademark "Macintosh" for use in connection with computer products. Although the Company believes the ownership of such patents, trademarks, copyrights, and licenses is an important factor in its business and that its success does depend in part on the ownership thereof, the Company relies primarily on the innovative skills, technical competence, and marketing abilities of its personnel. Because of technological changes in the computer industry, current extensive patent coverage, and the rapid rate of issuance of new patents, it is possible certain components of the Company's products may unknowingly infringe existing patents of others. The Company believes the resolution of any claim of infringements would not have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations as reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The Company has from time to time entered into cross-licensing agreements with other companies. SEASONAL BUSINESS Although the Company does not consider its business to be highly seasonal, it has historically experienced increased sales in its first and fourth fiscal quarters, compared to other quarters in its fiscal year, due to seasonal demand related to the beginning of the school year and the holiday season. However, past performance should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's future net sales or financial performance. WARRANTY The Company offers a limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware products. The warranty period is typically one year from the date of purchase by the end user. The Company also offers a 90-day warranty for Apple software and for Apple service parts used to repair Apple hardware products. In addition, consumers may purchase extended service coverage on most Apple hardware products in all of the Company's major markets. SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMERS No customer accounted for more than 10% of the Company's net sales in 1999, 1998, or 1997. BACKLOG In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of over ordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. COMPETITION The market for the design, manufacture, and sale of personal computers and related software and peripheral products is highly competitive. It continues to be characterized by rapid technological advances 5 in both hardware and software development, which have substantially increased the capabilities and applications of these products, and has resulted in the frequent introduction of new products. The principal competitive factors in this market are relative price/performance, product quality and reliability, design innovation, availability of software, product features, marketing and distribution capability, service and support, availability of hardware peripherals, and corporate reputation. The Company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of the recent innovations in the Windows platform. The Company's future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived functional and design advantages over competing platforms. Further discussion relating to the competitive conditions of the personal computing industry and the Company's competitive position in the marketplace may be found in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading "Competition," included under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Because the personal computer industry is characterized by rapid technological advances, the Company's ability to compete successfully is heavily dependent upon its ability to ensure a continuing and timely flow of competitive products and technology to the marketplace. The Company continues to develop new products and technologies and to enhance existing products in the areas of hardware and peripherals, system software, networking and communications, and the Internet. The Company's research and development expenditures, before charges for in-process research and development, totaled $314 million, $303 million, and $485 million in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. The declines in total expenditures for research and development in 1999 and 1998 as compared to 1997 were principally due to restructuring actions taken by the Company intended to focus the Company's research and development efforts on those projects perceived as critical to the Company's future success. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS Compliance with federal, state, and local laws and foreign laws enacted for the protection of the environment has to date had no material effect upon the Company's capital expenditures, earnings, or competitive position. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, no assurance can be given such laws, or any future laws enacted for the protection of the environment, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company. EMPLOYEES As of September 25, 1999, Apple and its subsidiaries worldwide had 6,960 regular employees, and an additional 2,776 temporary or part-time employees and contractors. FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA Information regarding financial data by geographic segment and the risks associated with international operations is set forth in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9, "Segment Information and Geographic Data," and in Part II, Item 7 of this Form 10-K under the subheading "Global Market Risks," included under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. Margins on sales of Apple products in foreign countries, and on domestic sales of products that include components obtained from foreign suppliers, can be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations and by international trade regulations, including tariffs and antidumping penalties. 6 ITEM 2. PROPERTIES The Company's headquarters are located in Cupertino, California. The Company has manufacturing facilities in Sacramento, California, Cork, Ireland, and Singapore. As of September 25, 1999, the Company leased approximately 3 million square feet of space, primarily in the United States, and to a lesser extent, in Europe and the Asia Pacific region. Leases are generally for terms of five to ten years, and usually provide renewal options for terms of up to five additional years. The Company owns its manufacturing facilities in Cork, Ireland, and Singapore, which total approximately 785,000 square feet. The Company also owns a 748,000 square-foot facility in Sacramento, California, which is used as a manufacturing, warehousing and distribution center. The Sacramento facility also houses a customer call center. In addition, the Company owns 930,000 square feet of facilities located in Cupertino, California, used for research and development and corporate functions. Outside the United States, the Company owns additional facilities totaling approximately 347,000 square feet. The Company believes its existing facilities and equipment are well maintained and in good operating condition. The Company has invested in internal capacity and strategic relationships with outside manufacturing vendors, and therefore believes it has adequate manufacturing capacity for the foreseeable future. The Company continues to make investments in capital equipment as needed to meet anticipated demand for its products.

This increase is primarily attributable to the success of iMac, the Company's moderately priced desktop Macintosh system designed for the education and consumer markets. The Company sold approximately 1.8 million iMac units in 1999, an increase of approximately 730,000 units or 68% over unit sales of similar products in 1998. Growth in unit sales was strong in all of the Company's geographic operating segments, particularly in Japan and Asia Pacific due to strong acceptance of iMac in those regions and the general economic improvements experienced in much of Asia during the year. The Company also experienced improved profitability in 1999. Operating income before special charges rose 44% or $118 million to $386 million in 1999 from $268 million in 1998. Contributing to the improvement in operating margin in 1999 was a rise in gross margin as a percentage of net sales to 28% as compared to 25% in 1998. The impact of improved gross margins was partially offset by planned increases in recurring operating expenses during 1999 of 8% to a total of $1.337 billion. Despite improved unit sales and improved profitability, the Company's net sales rose only 3% in 1999 to $6.134 billion. Growth in net sales was negatively impacted during the year by declines in the average revenue per Macintosh system for both Power Macintosh and iMac systems and by a shift in unit mix towards the lower priced iMac systems. Net sales were also negatively impacted during the fourth quarter of 1999 due to lower than planned deliveries of PowerPC G4 processors from Motorola. The primary focus of the Company during fiscal 2000 remains achieving meaningful year-over-year growth in both unit sales and net sales. The Company's future operating results and financial condition are dependent upon the Company's ability to successfully develop, manufacture, and market technologically innovative products in order to meet the dynamic conditions within the highly competitive market for personal computers. Potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the Company's future operating results and financial condition are discussed 10 throughout this Item 7, including the discussion under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition." NET SALES Net sales for geographic segments and Macintosh unit sales by geographic segment and by product follow (net sales in millions and Macintosh unit sales in thousands): 1999 CHANGE 1998 CHANGE 1997 -------- -------- -------- -------- -------- Americas net sales................................ $3,527 2 % $3,468 (5)% $3,668 Europe net sales.................................. $1,317 2 % $1,295 (16)% $1,536 Japan net sales................................... $ 858 17 % $ 731 (33)% $1,098 Asia Pacific net sales............................ $ 306 4 % $ 293 (38)% $ 472 Americas Macintosh unit sales..................... 2,021 22 % 1,655 6 % 1,568 Europe Macintosh unit sales....................... 724 23 % 588 (2)% 601 Japan Macintosh unit sales........................ 524 35 % 389 (25)% 516 Asia Pacific Macintosh unit sales................. 179 37 % 131 (31)% 189 ------ ------ ------ Total Macintosh unit sales...................... 3,448 25 % 2,763 (4)% 2,874 ====== ====== ====== Power Macintosh unit sales........................ 1,296 2 % 1,266 29 % 981 PowerBook unit sales.............................. 344 (19)% 427 2 % 417 iMac unit sales(a)................................ 1,802 68 % 1,070 (28)% 1,476 iBook unit sales.................................. 6 -- -- -- -- ------ ------ ------ Total Macintosh unit sales...................... 3,448 25 % 2,763 (4)% 2,874 ====== ====== ====== - ------------------------ (a) Unit sales figures for iMac in 1998 and 1997 include sales of the Company's previous consumer and education oriented Macintosh products. Net sales increased $193 million or 3% to $6.134 billion in 1999 compared to 1998. The primary source of this growth was an overall 25% increase in Macintosh unit sales, which was reflective of strong unit growth in all of the Company's geographic operating segments. Offsetting the rise in unit shipments was a decline in the average revenue per Macintosh system, a function of total net sales generated by hardware shipments and total Macintosh CPU unit sales, which fell 17% to $1,739 from $2,095 in 1998. The decline during 1999 in the average revenue per Macintosh system is attributable to lower pricing for both iMac and Power Macintosh products, which reflects the continuing overall industry trend towards lower pricing. The decline is also attributable to the shift in the Company's unit mix toward lower-priced consumer products such that iMac units and comparable products comprised 52% of total Macintosh unit sales in 1999 versus 39% in 1998. Net sales declined sequentially during the fourth quarter of 1999 compared to the third quarter by $222 million or 14%, and declined $220 million or 14% compared to the same period in 1998. Similarly, Macintosh unit sales declined 15% and 7% during the fourth quarter of 1999 compared to the third quarter of 1999 and the same period in 1998, respectively. The primary causes for these declines in both net sales and unit sales were lower than planned deliveries of PowerPC G4 processors from Motorola and production interruptions at vendors supplying PowerBooks and iBooks experienced during the last week of the fourth quarter of 1999 as a result of the earthquake in Taiwan on September 20, 1999. The shortage of G4 processors reduced net sales by approximately $200 million during the fourth quarter of 1999. Net sales decreased $1.140 billion, or 16%, to $5.941 billion in 1998 compared to 1997. The decline during 1998 in net sales is attributable to several factors. The Company experienced a $454 million decrease in net sales of peripheral products during 1998 compared to 1997 principally due to the discontinuance by the 11 Company of certain imaging and display products. The average revenue per Macintosh system fell 11% during 1998 as compared to 1997 from $2,375 to $2,095, reflecting the effect of aggressive pricing of the Company's Power Macintosh G3 systems introduced in the first quarter of fiscal 1998, the decline in net sales from the phase out of certain peripheral products, the overall industry trend toward lower priced products, and the Company's reentry during the fourth quarter of 1998 into the lower-priced consumer market. Lastly, overall Macintosh CPU unit sales for 1998 declined approximately 4% from 1997. International net sales were particularly affected by these factors and by the economic conditions existing in Asia during 1998. SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company's geographic segments include the Americas, Europe, Japan, and Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The European segment includes European countries as well as the Middle East and Africa. The Japan segment includes only Japan, while the Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and Asia except for Japan. Each geographic operating segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar services. Further information regarding the Company's operating segments may be found in Part II, Item 8 on this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 9, "Segment Information and Geographic Data," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. AMERICAS Net sales in the Americas segment increased 2% to $3.527 billion during 1999 as compared to 1998, while Macintosh unit sales increased 22%. This followed a 5% decline in net sales in the Americas between 1998 and 1997. During 1999, the Americas segment represented approximately 57% and 59% of the Company's total net sales and total Macintosh unit sales, respectively. The results experienced by this segment in 1999 reflect the overall trends experienced by the Company of growing Macintosh unit sales offset by declines in the average revenue per Macintosh system. EUROPE Net sales in the Europe segment increased 2% to $1.317 billion during 1999 as compared to 1998, while Macintosh unit sales increased 23%. This followed a 16% decline in net sales in the Europe segment between 1998 and 1997. Like the Americas segment, Europe's results in 1999 as compared to 1998 are indicative of strong growth in Macintosh unit sales offset by declines in the average revenue per Macintosh system. JAPAN AND ASIA PACIFIC Macintosh unit sales and net sales in Asia, particularly in Japan, recovered during 1999 from the declines experienced in 1998. Net sales in the Japan segment increased 17% or $127 million to a total of $858 million in 1999 as compared to 1998. Macintosh unit sales in Japan increased 35% during 1999 compared to 1998 while Macintosh unit sales in the Asia Pacific segment increased 37%. The increases in net sales and Macintosh unit sales in both Japan and Asia Pacific are the result of strong iMac sales experienced by these operating segments, strong growth in Japanese consumer sales, and the general economic recovery experienced in the region. BACKLOG In the Company's experience, the actual amount of product backlog at any particular time is not a meaningful indication of its future business prospects. In particular, backlog often increases in anticipation of or immediately following new product introductions because of overordering by dealers anticipating shortages. Backlog often is reduced once dealers and customers believe they can obtain sufficient supply. Because of the foregoing, backlog should not be considered a reliable indicator of the Company's ability to achieve any particular level of revenue or financial performance. Further information regarding the Company's backlog may be found below under the subheading "Product Introductions and Transitions" 12 included under the heading "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. GROSS MARGIN Gross margin increased as a percentage of net sales during 1999 to 28% as compared to 25% in 1998. This increase was primarily attributable to declines in the cost of various components of the Company's products, improvements in manufacturing efficiencies brought about by selective outsourcing of final assembly of certain of the Company's products, improved design of products leading to lower manufacturing and warranty costs, and relatively stable pricing of the Company's products over the last six months of 1999. During 1999, the Company was also able to fully realize the benefits of actions taken primarily in 1998 and 1997 that led to improved inventory management and a more efficient distribution model for its products. These improvements are discussed below. Gross margin increased as a percentage of net sales during 1998 to 25% compared to 19% in 1997. This increase was primarily the result of a shift in revenue mix toward the Company's higher margin Power Macintosh G3 systems and newer PowerBook G3 systems, the low volume of lower margin consumer products shipped during the first three quarters of 1998, and the declining cost of various components of the Company's products, particularly those sourced from Asia. Improvements in the Company's inventory management also contributed to the increase in gross margins. During 1998, the Company simplified its product line, moving from approximately 15 separate individual products to three main product families. Further, the Company attempted to use as many industry standard parts in its newer products as possible, expanded the use of supplier hubs at manufacturing sites, and outsourced the manufacture of printed circuit boards and some systems assembly. These changes have allowed the Company to more accurately forecast demand, reduce inventory carrying levels and related costs, lessen the financial exposure resulting from inventory obsolescence and excess inventory levels, and reduce the component cost of obtaining certain standardized parts. The Company also made changes to its distribution model during 1998 and 1997 that contributed to the increase in gross margins in 1998. The Company significantly reduced the number of locations where it stages finished goods, generally holding inventory on a regional basis rather than in each country. Also, the Company significantly reduced the number of its distributors, authorized resellers, and national retail channel partners, particularly in the United States. These changes allowed the Company to reduce inventory and related financial exposures and reduced the inventory and related financial exposure associated with inventory held in the Company's distribution channels. The Company has also revised its distribution channel policies by decreasing the price protection and stock return privileges of its distributors and resellers. The Company anticipates that as lower priced consumer products become a larger share of net sales and the overall industry trend toward lower-priced products continues, gross margins will decline during fiscal 2000. The foregoing statement is forward-looking. The Company's actual results could differ because of several factors, including those set forth in the following paragraph and below in the subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition." There can be no assurance targeted gross margin levels will be achieved or current margins on existing individual products will be maintained. In general, gross margins and margins on individual products will remain under significant downward pressure due to a variety of factors, including continued industry wide global pricing pressures, increased competition, compressed product life cycles, potential increases in the cost and availability of raw material and outside manufacturing services, and potential changes to the Company's product mix, including higher unit sales of consumer products with lower average selling prices and lower gross margins. In response to these downward pressures, the Company expects it will continue to take pricing actions with respect to its products. Gross margins could also be affected by the Company's ability to effectively manage quality problems and warranty costs and to stimulate demand for certain of its products. The Company's operating strategy and pricing take into account anticipated changes in foreign 13 currency exchange rates over time; however, the Company's results of operations can be significantly affected in the short term by fluctuations in exchange rates. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT The Company recognizes focused investments in research and development are critical to its future growth and competitive position in the marketplace and are directly related to timely development of new and enhanced products that are central to the Company's core business strategy. Expenditures on research and development increased 4% or $11 million to $314 million in 1999 as compared to 1998. This followed a $182 million or 38% decline in 1998 as compared to 1997. The overall decline in spending on research and development over the last two years is principally due to restructuring actions taken in 1996, 1997, and 1998 intended to focus the Company's research and development efforts on those projects perceived as critical to the Company's future success. These restructuring actions led to significant reductions in research and development related headcount and the cancellation of many research and development projects. SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE Selling, general, and administrative expenditures increased 10% to $996 million in 1999 as compared to 1998 and increased to 16% of net sales in 1999 from 15% in 1998. These increases are primarily the result of increased spending on marketing and promotional activities throughout 1999 and a 12% increase in combined sales, marketing, and general and administrative headcount from the end of 1998 to the end of 1999. Selling, general, and administrative expenditures declined $378 million or 29% in 1998 compared to 1997 and declined to 15% of net sales in 1998 from 18% of net sales in 1997. These decreases were primarily the result of restructuring actions taken in 1996, 1997, and 1998, which resulted in reductions in headcount, closing of facilities, and write-down and disposal of operating assets during 1996, 1997, and 1998. Additionally, changes during 1998 in the Company's distribution channel policies and business model, including contraction and focus of the Company's product line and simplification of the Company's internal and external distribution channels, led to a reduction in selling expenses during 1998. SPECIAL CHARGES 1996 AND 1997 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to implement a restructuring plan designed to reduce costs and return the Company to profitability. The restructuring plan was necessitated by decreased demand for the Company's products and the Company's adoption of a new strategic direction. These actions resulted in a charge during 1996 of $179 million. During 1997, the Company announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring actions to meet the foregoing objectives of the plan. The Company recognized a $217 million charge during 1997 for the estimated incremental costs of those actions. All material restructuring actions contemplated under the plan were essentially complete at the end of fiscal 1998. The combined 1996 and 1997 restructuring actions consisted of terminating approximately 4,200 full-time employees; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a result of those employee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings, and equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing various operational functions; and canceling contracts for projects and technologies that were not critical to the Company's core business strategy. The restructuring actions under the plan resulted in cash expenditures of $293 million and noncash asset write-downs of $95 million from the second quarter of 1996 through September 25, 1999. Of the combined 1996 and 1997 restructuring charges of $396 million, approximately $3 million was determined to be excess during the fourth quarter of 1999. The remaining balance of $5 million as of September 25, 1999, in accrued restructuring costs for the 1996 and 1997 restructuring actions is comprised of payments over the next two years on leases and contracts that had been terminated prior to fiscal 1999. The Company expects the remaining accrual will result in cash expenditures of $5 million over the next two years. 14 1999 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company initiated restructuring actions resulting in a charge to operations of $21 million. The net restructuring charge of $18 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 1999 reflects the $3 million of excess reserves related to the 1996 and 1997 restructuring actions. The total cost of these actions of $21 million is comprised of $11 million for contract cancellation charges associated with the closure of the Company's outsourced data center and $10 million for contract cancellation charges related to supply and development agreements previously discontinued. The Company expects these actions to result in cash expenditures of $21 million over the next year. During the second quarter of 1999, the Company took certain actions to improve the flexibility and efficiency of its manufacturing operations by moving final assembly of certain of its products to third-party manufacturers. These restructuring actions resulted in the Company recognizing a charge to operations of approximately $9 million during the second quarter of 1999, which was comprised of $6 million for severance benefits to be paid to employees involuntarily terminated, $2 million for the write-down of operating assets to be disposed of, and $1 million for payments on canceled contracts. These actions resulted in the termination of approximately 580 employees and are substantially complete as of September 25, 1999. IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT In May 1998, the Company acquired certain technology that was under development and had no alternative future use. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $7 million of purchased in-process research and development, which was charged to operations upon acquisition. In February 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of NeXT Software, Inc. (NeXT). NeXT had developed, marketed, and supported software enabling customers to implement business applications on the Internet/World Wide Web, intranets and enterprise-wide client/server networks. Of the total purchase price of $427 million, $375 million was allocated to purchased in-process research and development and $52 million was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets. The purchased in-process research and development was charged to operations upon acquisition, and the goodwill and other intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over two to three years. TERMINATION OF LICENSE AGREEMENT In August 1997, the Company agreed to acquire certain assets of Power Computing Corporation (PCC), a licensed distributor of the Mac OS operating system, including PCC's customer database and its license to distribute the Mac OS. The agreement with PCC also included a release of claims between the parties. On January 28, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets from PCC. The total purchase price was approximately $110 million, of which $75 million was expensed in the fourth quarter of 1997 as "termination of license agreement" and $35 million was recorded as goodwill in the second quarter of 1998. The goodwill is being amortized over three years. INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET Interest and other income and expense (net) increased $59 million or 211% to $87 million during 1999 as compared to 1998. This increase is attributable to two primary factors. First, the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments increased $926 million or 40% during 1999 resulting in an increase in interest income during 1999 of $44 million. Second, interest expense declined $15 million during 1999, primarily as a result of the conversion of approximately $661 million of the Company's convertible subordinated notes to common stock during the third quarter of 1999. During 1998, the Company experienced a $27 million increase in interest income net of interest expense, the result of higher cash and investment balances and lower average short-term borrowings, offset by decreased foreign exchange gains and increased other expense. 15 GAINS FROM SALES OF INVESTMENT As of September 26, 1997, the Company owned 42.3% of the outstanding stock of ARM Holdings plc (ARM), a privately held company in the United Kingdom involved in the design of high performance microprocessors and related technology. The Company had accounted for this investment using the equity method through September 25, 1998. On April 17, 1998, ARM completed an initial public offering of its stock on the London Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ National Market. The Company sold 18.9% of its shares in the offering for a gain before foreign taxes of approximately $24 million, which was recognized as other income. Foreign tax recognized on this gain was approximately $7 million. At the time an equity method investee sells existing or newly issued common stock to unrelated parties in excess of its book value, the equity method requires the net book value of the investment be adjusted to reflect the investor's share of the change in the investee's shareholders' equity resulting from the sale. It is the Company's policy to record an adjustment reflecting its share of the change in the investee's shareholders' equity resulting from such a sale as a gain or loss in other income. Consequently, the Company also recognized in the third quarter of 1998 other income of approximately $16 million to reflect its remaining 25.9% ownership interest in the increased net book value of ARM following its initial public offering. As of September 25, 1998, the carrying value of the Company's investment in ARM carried in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet was approximately $22 million. On October 14, 1998, the Company sold 11.6 million shares (split adjusted) of ARM stock. As a result of this sale, the Company's ownership interest in ARM fell to 19.7%. Consequently, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company ceased accounting for its remaining investment in ARM using the equity method and categorized its remaining shares as available-for-sale requiring the shares be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. During fiscal 1999, the Company sold approximately 32.6 million shares (split adjusted) of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $245 million, recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $230 million, and recognized related income tax of approximately $25 million. As of September 25, 1999, the Company's remaining 16 million shares of ARM stock are valued at $226 million. The fair value of the Company's investment in ARM is reflected in other assets as of September 25, 1999, with an offsetting amount net of $84 million of related deferred income taxes recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. PROVISION (BENEFIT) FOR INCOME TAXES As of September 25, 1999, the Company had deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences, tax losses, and tax credits of $613 million before being offset against certain deferred tax liabilities for presentation on the Company's balance sheet. A substantial portion of this asset is realizable based on the ability to offset existing deferred tax liabilities. As of September 25, 1999, a valuation allowance of $60 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and to tax benefits in certain foreign jurisdictions. The Company will continue to evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets quarterly by assessing the need for and amount of the valuation allowance. The Company's effective tax rate for fiscal 1999 was 11% compared to the higher statutory rate due primarily to the reversal of a portion of the previously established valuation allowance and certain undistributed foreign earnings for which no U.S. taxes were provided. The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) has proposed federal income tax deficiencies for the years 1984 through 1991, and the Company has made certain prepayments thereon. The Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although most of the issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still remain in dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. 16 The Company anticipates its effective tax rate for fiscal 2000 will be approximately 25%. The foregoing statement is forward-looking. The Company's actual results could differ because of several factors, including those set forth below in the subsection entitled "Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition." Additionally, the actual future tax rate will be significantly impacted by the amount of and jurisdiction in which the Company's foreign profits are earned. LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES The following table presents selected financial information and statistics for each of the last three fiscal years (dollars in millions): 1999 1998 1997 -------- -------- -------- Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments.......... $3,226 $2,300 $1,459 Accounts receivable, net.................................... $ 681 $ 955 $1,035 Inventory................................................... $ 20 $ 78 $ 437 Working capital............................................. $2,736 $2,178 $1,606 Days sales in accounts receivable(a)........................ 46 56 58 Days of supply in inventory(b).............................. 2 6 31 Operating cash flow......................................... $ 798 $ 775 $ 154 - ------------------------ (a) Based on ending net trade receivables and most recent quarterly net sales for each period. (b) Based on ending inventory and most recent quarterly cost of sales for each period. As of September 25, 1999, the Company had $3.226 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, an increase of $926 million or 40% over the same balances at the end of fiscal 1998. During fiscal 1999, the Company's primary source of cash was $798 million in cash flows from operating activities. Cash generated by operations was primarily from net income, declines in accounts receivables and inventory resulting from improved asset management, and an increase in accounts payable. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of September 25, 1999 and 1998, include $4 million and $56 million, respectively, pledged as collateral to support letters of credit. In addition to the net purchase of short-term investments of $1.081 billion, net cash used by investing activities included $112 million for the purchase of investments in Samsung and Akamai discussed below and $47 million for the purchase of fixed assets. These uses of cash were partially offset by proceeds from the sale of ARM stock of $245 million and proceeds from the sale of equipment of $23 million. The Company expects the level of capital expenditures in 2000 will increase moderately from 1999. In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. As of September 25, 1999, the Company had repurchased a total of 1.25 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $75 million. On November 18, 1999, the Company entered into a $100 million revolving credit agreement with Bank of America. Loans under the agreement pay interest at LIBOR plus 1%, and the Company is required to pay a commitment fee of 0.2% of the unused portion of the credit facility. No advances have been made against this credit facility. This revolving credit agreement is intended to provide the Company with an additional source of liquidity and to provide additional support to the Company's capital position in the event of short-term liquidity disturbances in worldwide financial markets associated with the Year 2000 crossover. The Company believes its balances of cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments will be sufficient to meet its cash requirements over the next twelve months, including any cash utilized by its stock repurchase plan. However, given the Company's current non-investment grade debt ratings, if the Company should need to obtain short-term borrowings, there can no assurance such borrowings could be 17 obtained at favorable rates. The inability to obtain such borrowings at favorable rates could materially adversely affect the Company's results of operations, financial condition, and liquidity. OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS As discussed above, the Company has categorized its shares in ARM as available-for-sale requiring the shares be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. As of September 25, 1999, the Company held 16 million shares of ARM stock valued at $226 million. During the first quarter of fiscal 2000 through December 17, 1999, the Company sold an additional 5.1 million shares of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $136 million and gains before taxes of approximately $134 million. As of December 17, 1999, the Company holds 10.9 million shares of ARM stock valued at approximately $690 million. During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company invested $100 million in Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (Samsung) to assist in the further expansion of Samsung's TFT-LCD flat-panel display production capacity. The investment, in the form of three year unsecured bonds, is convertible into approximately 550,000 shares of Samsung common stock beginning in June 2000. The bonds carry an annual coupon rate of 2% and pay a total yield to maturity of 5% if redeemed at their maturity. In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), a global Internet content delivery service. The investment was in the form of convertible preferred stock that converted into 4.1 million shares of Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits) at the time of Akamai's initial public offering in October 1999. The Company is restricted from selling more than 25% of its shares within one year after the date of the closing of a public offering of Akamai's stock. Beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 2000, the Company has categorized its shares in Akamai as available-for-sale requiring they be carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. As of December 17, 1999, the fair value of the Company's investment in Akamai was approximately $1.2 billion. Because Akamai is a newly public company and its stock price has experienced significant volatility, the fair value of the Company's investment in Akamai may fluctuate significantly in the future. YEAR 2000 COMPLIANCE THE INFORMATION PRESENTED BELOW RELATED TO YEAR 2000 (Y2K) COMPLIANCE CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW AND ELSEWHERE IN THIS FORM 10-K REGARDING Y2K COMPLIANCE. YEAR 2000 The Year 2000 (Y2K) issue is the result of certain computer hardware, operating system software and software application programs having been developed using two digits rather than four to define a year. For example, the clock circuit in the hardware may be incapable of holding a date beyond the year 1999; some operating systems may recognize a date using "00" as the year 1900 rather than 2000 and certain applications may have limited date processing capabilities. These problems could result in the failure of major systems or miscalculations, which could have a material impact on companies through business interruption or shutdown, financial loss, damage to reputation, and legal liability to third parties. Y2K PLAN The Company's Information Systems and Technology department (IS&T) began addressing the Y2K issue in 1996 as part of its Next Generation strategy, which addressed the need for ongoing enhancement and replacement of the Company's various disparate legacy information technology (IT) Systems. In 1998, the Company established a Year 2000 Executive Steering Committee (Steering Committee) comprised of senior executives of the Company and the Company's Year 2000 Project Management Office (PMO). The PMO reports to the Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, the Steering Committee, and the Audit and Finance Committee of the Board of Directors. 18 The PMO developed and manages the Company's worldwide Y2K strategic plan (Y2K Plan) to address the potential impact of Y2K on the Company's operations and business processes. In particular, the Y2K Plan addresses four principal areas that may be impacted by the Y2K issue: Apple Branded Products; Third Party Relationships; Non-IT Business Systems; and IT Systems. With respect to the IT Systems and Non-IT Business Systems, the Y2K Plan consists of four separate but overlapping phases: Phase I--Inventory and Risk Assessment; Phase II--Remediation Cost Estimation; Phase III--Remediation; and Phase IV--Remediation Testing. In addition, the Company has an ongoing Y2K Awareness Program designed to keep employees informed about Y2K issues. The discussion below reflects management's estimate of the current status of the four principal areas of the Company's Y2K Plan. Regardless of the current status, all areas of the Y2K Plan remain under review and subject to modification as deemed necessary throughout the remainder of calendar 1999 through the date rollover and into January 2000. APPLE BRANDED PRODUCTS The Company designs and manufactures personal computers, related peripherals, operating system software and application software, including Macintosh personal computers and the Mac OS, which are marketed under the "Apple" brand (collectively "Apple Branded Products"). The Company tested certain Apple Branded Products to determine Y2K compliance, although such testing did not include third party products bundled with Apple Branded Products and certain Apple Branded Products no longer distributed and/or supported by the Company. For purposes of this discussion, Y2K compliant means a product will not produce errors processing date data in connection with the year change from December 31, 1999, to January 1, 2000, when used with accurate date data in accordance with its documentation, provided all other products (including other software, firmware and hardware) used with it properly exchange date data with it. A Y2K compliant product will recognize the Year 2000 as a leap year. Information about testing and Y2K compliance of Apple Branded Products is available on the Apple corporate web site under the heading "Year 2000 Readiness Disclosure", at www.apple.com/about/year/. Such information, which is updated on an ongoing basis, is not to be considered part of this annual report. Because the Company does not control the design of non-Apple Branded Products or third party products that are bundled with Apple Branded Products, it cannot assure such products are Y2K compliant. Some Apple Branded Products installed at customer sites may require upgrades or other remediation. While the Company believes its customers are responsible for the Y2K readiness of their IT and business environments, the Company has taken steps to assist customers in achieving their readiness goals. Apple is issuing software updates (at no additional charge) for most, but not all, known issues in certain Apple Branded Products. THIRD PARTY RELATIONSHIPS The Company's business operations are heavily dependent on third party corporate service vendors, materials suppliers, outsourced operations partners, distributors and others. The Company is working with key external parties to identify and attempt to mitigate the potential risks to it of Y2K. The failure of external parties to resolve their own Y2K issues in a timely manner could result in a material financial risk to the Company. As part of its Y2K Plan and to establish the state of readiness of certain third parties, the Company is actively communicating on an ongoing basis with certain third parties whose lack of Y2K compliance would present a high degree of risk to the Company. Based on information obtained from various sources, the Company believes it is reasonably possible there will be interruptions around the world in critical services such as air traffic control, airfreight transportation, customs clearance, telecommunications, and power utilities early in calendar year 2000 that could result in shipping delays of raw material and finished goods. The Company also believes it is reasonably possible that worldwide financial markets could exhibit unusual short-term volatility and liquidity disturbances at the end of calendar 1999 and at the beginning of calendar 2000. Such events could result in material adverse effects on the Company's results of operations and financial position. See further discussion regarding this issue below under the heading "Contingency Plans." The Company has substantially completed its review of certain third parties as of the 19 end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999. Although numerous third parties have advised the Company they are addressing their Y2K issues, the readiness of third parties overall varies widely. Because the Company's Y2K compliance is dependent on the timely Y2K compliance of third parties, there can be no assurances the Company's efforts alone will resolve all Y2K issues. The Company continues to communicate with and monitor the compliance efforts of key third parties. The Company will continue these efforts with key third parties through the date rollover and into January 2000. IT SYSTEMS AND NON-IT BUSINESS SYSTEMS Phase I--Inventory and Risk Assessment: This Phase requires an inventory and assessment of the Non-IT Business Systems used by the Company, including systems with embedded technology, building access systems, and health and safety systems. This Phase also includes inventory and assessment of IT Systems used by the Company, including large IS&T systems, desktop hardware and software, and network hardware and software. Each system is evaluated and the business risk is quantified as being High, Medium or Low Risk to the Company's business. Systems that are High Risk are those, which if uncorrected, would cause an interruption of or complete failure to conduct the Company's business. Medium Risks are those that would negatively impact the business but complete cessation could be avoided with some inconvenience. Low Risks are those where the risk to business interruption or cessation are remote. The Company intends that High and Medium Risk items will be remediated or replaced, and Low Risk items will likely not be addressed prior to the Year 2000. The status of the Company's remediation efforts is discussed below. The Company had substantially completed the Inventory and Risk Assessment Phase for both IT Systems and Non-IT Systems by the end of the third quarter of fiscal 1999. However, the Company has and will continue to review information developed as the result of its Y2K Plan, which could result in additional items being added to its Y2K inventory. Phase II--Remediation Cost Estimation: This Phase involves the analysis of each High and Medium Risk to determine how such risks may be remediated and the cost of such remediation. The Company has substantially completed this Phase for both IT and Non-IT Business Systems. Phase III--Remediation: This Phase includes the replacement or correction of the High and Medium Risk Non-IT Business Systems and IT Systems. The Company substantially completed this Phase for both IT and Non-IT Business Systems during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999. Phase IV--Remediation Testing: This Phase includes the future date testing of the remediation efforts made in Phase III to confirm that the changes made bring the affected systems into compliance, no new problems have arisen as a result of the remediation, and new systems that replaced noncompliant systems are Y2K compliant. The Company substantially completed this Phase for both IT and Non-IT Business Systems during the first quarter of fiscal 2000. COSTS TO ADDRESS Y2K The costs of the Y2K program are primarily costs associated with the utilization of existing internal resources and incremental external spending. The Company's current estimate of total incremental external spending over the life of its Y2K plan to address those risks identified as High or Medium is approximately $10 million of which approximately $9 million had been spent as of September 25, 1999. As the Company's Y2K Plan continues, the actual future incremental spending may prove to be higher. Also, this estimate does not include the costs that could be incurred by the Company if one or more of its significant third party vendors fails to achieve Y2K compliance. The Company is not separately identifying 20 and including in these estimates the Y2K costs incurred that are the result of utilization of the Company's existing internal resources. CONTINGENCY PLANS Under the guidance and management of the PMO, the Company is in the final stages of developing, implementing, and testing Y2K contingency plans for critical business operations. The Company's contingency plans, which are based in part on the assessment of the magnitude and probability of potential risks, primarily focus on proactive steps to prevent Y2K failures from occurring, or if they should occur, to detect them quickly, minimize their impact and expedite their remediation. The Y2K contingency plans will supplement existing disaster recovery and business continuity plans. As part of its contingency plans, the Company has developed a global Incident Management Team (IMT) to identify, escalate, and mitigate the potential impact of various Y2K failures. The IMT is comprised of personnel from the PMO as well as key areas of the Company's operations. The IMT will begin to monitor the date rollover commencing with Sydney, Australia and will "follow the sun" through the time change in the Pacific Standard Time zone. The Company's contingency planning efforts were approximately 85% complete at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999 and are expected to be substantially completed during the first quarter of fiscal 2000. The Company believes it is reasonably possible there will be interruptions in air traffic control, airfreight transportation, customs clearance, telecommunications, and power utilities early in calendar year 2000 that could result in shipping delays of raw material and finished goods and other business interruptions. The Company has developed and implemented contingency plans to mitigate the effects of a short-term interruption in such services. However, if the interruption in these services last for an extended period of time, or if alternative Y2K compliant services are not readily available at reasonable cost, there could be material adverse effects on the Company's results of operations and financial position. The Company also believes it is reasonably possible worldwide financial markets could exhibit unusual short-term volatility and liquidity disturbances at the end of calendar 1999 and at the beginning of calendar 2000. The Company has developed and implemented contingency plans to mitigate some of the potential short-term effects of such disturbances. However, if these disturbances in the financial markets last for an extended period of time, or if alternative mitigating actions are not readily available at reasonable cost, there could be material adverse effects on the Company's results of operations and financial position. RISK FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH Y2K ISSUES The Company has substantially completed its initial assessment of reasonably likely worst case scenarios of Non-IT Business Systems and/or IT Systems failures and related consequences. Based on current information, the Company believes the most likely worst case scenario is it will experience minor malfunctions and failures of its IT Systems and Non-IT Business Systems at the beginning of the Year 2000 not previously detected during the Company's inventory and risk assessment and remediation activities. The Company currently believes these malfunctions and failures will not have a material impact on its results of operations or financial condition. However, there can be no assurance the Y2K remediation by the Company or third parties will be properly and timely completed, and the failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company, its business, its results of operations, and its financial condition. In particular, the Company believes a lack of Y2K readiness by its significant third party vendors could cause material interruptions in the Company's operations. The identification of additional issues with respect to the Y2K compliance of key third parties could have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations. In addition, important factors that could cause results to differ materially include, but are not limited to, the ability of the Company to successfully identify systems and vendors that have a Y2K issue, the nature and amount of remediation effort required to fix the affected systems, the adequacy of such remediation efforts, the production-related contingency plans of competitors with the Company's 21 third party suppliers, and the costs and availability of labor and resources to successfully address the Y2K issues and/or to execute on any required contingency plans. FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COMPETITION The personal computer industry is highly competitive and is characterized by aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure on gross margins, frequent introduction of new products, short product life cycles, continual improvement in product price/performance characteristics, price sensitivity on the part of consumers, and a large number of competitors. The Company's results of operations and financial condition have been, and in the future may continue to be, adversely affected by industry wide pricing pressures and downward pressures on gross margins. The industry has also been characterized by rapid technological advances in software functionality, hardware performance, and features based on existing or emerging industry standards. Several competitors of the Company have either targeted or announced their intention to target certain of the Company's key market segments, including consumer, education and publishing. Additionally, several of the Company's competitors have introduced or announced plans to introduce products that mimic many of the unique design and technical features of the Company's products. Many of the Company's competitors have greater financial, marketing, manufacturing, and technological resources, as well as broader product lines and larger installed customer bases than those of the Company. Additionally, the Company's future operating results and financial condition may be affected by overall demand for personal computers and general customer preferences for one platform over another or one set of product features over another. The Company is currently the only maker of hardware using the Mac OS. The Mac OS has a minority market share in the personal computer market, which is dominated by makers of computers utilizing Microsoft Windows operating systems. The Company believes the innovative industrial design of its products, the unique set of features its products currently provide, the perceived advantages of the Mac OS over Windows, and the general reluctance of the Macintosh installed base to incur the costs of switching platforms, have been driving forces behind sales of the Company's personal computer hardware in recent years. The Company is currently taking and will continue to take steps to respond to the competitive pressures being placed on its personal computer sales as a result of the recent innovations in the Windows platform. The Company's future operating results and financial condition are substantially dependent on its ability to continue to develop improvements to the Macintosh platform in order to maintain perceived design and functional advantages over competing platforms. PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS Due to the highly volatile nature of the personal computer industry, which is characterized by dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies and enhance existing products in order to remain competitive. The success of new product introductions is dependent on a number of factors, including market acceptance, the Company's ability to manage the risks associated with product transitions, the availability of application software for new products, the effective management of inventory levels in line with anticipated product demand, the availability of products in appropriate quantities to meet anticipated demand, and the risk that new products may have quality or other defects in the early stages of introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine the ultimate effect that new products will have on its sales or results of operations. The Company plans to continue to introduce upgrades to the current Mac OS, Mac OS 9, and later introduce a new operating system, Mac OS X Client, which is expected to offer advanced functionality based on Apple and NeXT software technologies. It is uncertain whether Mac OS X will gain developer support and market acceptance. Inability to successfully develop and make timely delivery of a substantially backward-compatible Mac OS X or of planned enhancements to the current Mac OS, or to gain 22 developer support and market acceptance for those operating systems, may have an adverse impact on the Company's operating results and financial condition. INVENTORY AND SUPPLY The Company records a write-down for inventories of components and products that have become obsolete or are in excess of anticipated demand and accrues for any cancellation fees of orders for inventories that have been canceled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related provisions are adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace of product obsolescence in the computer industry, no assurance can be given the Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. In addition, such charges have had, and may again have, a material effect on the Company's financial position and results of operations. The Company must order components for its products and build inventory in advance of product shipments. Because the Company's markets are volatile and subject to rapid technology and price changes, there is a risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce excess or insufficient inventories of particular products. The Company's operating results and financial condition have been in the past and may in the future be materially adversely affected by the Company's ability to manage its inventory levels and respond to short-term shifts in customer demand patterns. Many of the Company's products are manufactured in whole or in part by third-party manufacturers. In addition, the Company has outsourced much of its transportation and logistics management. While outsourcing arrangements may lower the fixed cost of operations, they also reduce the Company's direct control over production and distribution. It is uncertain what effect such diminished control will have on the quality or quantity of the products manufactured, or the flexibility of the Company to respond to changing market conditions. Moreover, although arrangements with such manufacturers may contain provisions for warranty expense reimbursement, the Company remains at least initially responsible to the ultimate consumer for warranty service. Accordingly, in the event of product defects or warranty liability, the Company may remain primarily liable. Any unanticipated product defect or warranty liability, whether pursuant to arrangements with contract manufacturers or otherwise, could adversely affect the Company's future operating results and financial condition. Although certain components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application specific integrated circuits ("ASICs")) are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. Some other key components (including without limitation DRAM and TFT-LCD flat-panel displays), while currently available to the Company from multiple sources, are at times subject to industry wide availability and pricing pressures. If the supply of a key component were to be delayed or constrained, the Company's business and financial performance could be adversely affected, depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or, if possible, to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternate source. The Company and other producers in the personal computer industry also compete for other semiconductor products with other industries that have experienced increased demand for such products, due to either increased consumer demand or increased use of semiconductors in their products (such as the cellular phone and automotive industries). Finally, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry (including certain microprocessors and ASICs). Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of components other than those customized to meet the Company's requirements. Such product supply constraints and corresponding increased costs could decrease the Company's net sales and adversely affect the Company's operating results and financial condition. The Company's ability to produce and market competitive products is also dependent on the ability and desire of IBM and Motorola, the sole suppliers of the PowerPC RISC-based microprocessor for the Company's Macintosh computers, to provide the Company with a sufficient supply of microprocessors with 23 price/performance features that compare favorably to those supplied to the Company's competitors by Intel Corporation, and other developers and producers of microprocessors used by personal computers using the Windows operating systems. Further discussion relating to availability and supply of components and product may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Raw Materials," and in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K in the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements at Note 8 under the subheading "Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION The Company distributes its products through wholesalers, resellers, national and regional retailers and cataloguers, and directly to education institutions for resale (collectively referred to as "resellers"). In addition, the Company also sells many of its products in most of its major markets directly to end users through its on-line store. Many of the Company's significant resellers operate on narrow product margins. Most such resellers also distribute products from competing manufacturers. The Company's business and financial results could be adversely affected if the financial condition of these resellers weakened, if resellers within consumer channels were to cease distribution of the Company's products, or if uncertainty regarding demand for the Company's products causes resellers to reduce their ordering and marketing of the Company's products. Further information regarding risks associated with Marketing and Distribution may be found in Part I, Item 1 of this Form 10-K under the heading "Markets and Distribution," which information is hereby incorporated by reference. GLOBAL MARKET RISKS A large portion of the Company's revenue is derived from its international operations. As a result, the Company's operating results and financial condition could be significantly affected by risks associated with international activities, including economic and labor conditions, political instability, tax laws (including U.S. taxes on foreign subsidiaries), and changes in the value of the U.S. dollar versus the local currency in which the products are sold and goods and services are purchased. Countries in the Asia Pacific region, including Japan, have recently experienced weaknesses in their currency, banking and equity markets. These weaknesses have adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect consumer demand for the Company's products, the U.S. dollar value of the Company's foreign currency denominated sales, the availability and cost of product components to the Company, and consequently the Company's results of operations. Further information related to the Company's global market risks may be found in Part II, Item 7A of this Form 10-K under the subheading "Foreign Currency Risk" and may be found in Part II, Item 8 of this Form 10-K at Notes 1 and 2 of Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which information is hereby incorporated by reference. SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS Decisions by customers to purchase the Company's personal computers, as opposed to Windows-based systems, are often based on the availability of third-party software for particular applications. The Company believes the availability of third-party application software for the Company's hardware products depends in part on third-party developers' perception and analysis of the relative benefits of developing, maintaining, and upgrading such software for the Company's products versus software for the larger Windows market. This analysis is based on factors such as the perceived strength of the Company and its products, the anticipated potential revenue that may be generated, and the costs of developing such software products. To the extent the Company's financial losses in prior years and declining demand for the Company's products, as well as the Company's decision to end its Mac OS licensing program, have caused 24 software developers to question the Company's prospects in the personal computer market, developers could be less inclined to develop new application software or upgrade existing software for the Company's products and more inclined to devote their resources to developing and upgrading software for the larger Windows market. Moreover, the Company's current plan to introduce Mac OS X could cause software developers to stop developing software for the current Mac OS. In addition, there can be no assurance software developers will decide to develop software for the new operating system on a timely basis or at all. In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft entered into patent cross licensing and technology agreements. In addition, for a period of five years from August 1997, as subject to certain limitations related to the number of Macintosh computers sold by the Company, Microsoft will make future versions of its Microsoft Office and Internet Explorer products for the Mac OS. The Company will bundle the Internet Explorer product with Mac OS system software releases and make that product the default Internet browser for such releases. While the Company believes its relationship with Microsoft has been and will continue to be beneficial to the Company and to its efforts to increase the installed base for the Mac OS, the Microsoft relationship is for a limited term and does not cover many of the areas in which the Company competes with Microsoft, including the Windows platform. Accordingly, Microsoft's interest in producing application software for the Mac OS not covered by the relationship or following expiration of the agreements may be influenced by Microsoft's perception of its interests as the vendor of the Windows operating system. In addition, the Microsoft relationship may have an adverse effect on, among other things, the Company's relationship with other partners. There can be no assurance the benefits to the Company of the Microsoft relationship will not be offset by the disadvantages. EURO CONVERSION On January 1, 1999, eleven of the fifteen member countries of the European Union adopted the Euro as their common legal currency and established fixed conversion rates between their existing sovereign currencies and the Euro. The Euro is now traded on currency exchanges and is available for non-cash transactions. A three year transition period began during which transactions can be made in the old currencies. The Company has taken steps to evaluate internal system capabilities, review the ability of financial institution vendors to support Euro transactions, and examine current marketing and pricing policies and strategies in light of the Euro conversion. The cost of this effort is not expected to have a material adverse effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. There can be no assurance, however, all issues related to the Euro conversion have been identified and that any additional issues would not have a material effect on the Company's results of operations or financial condition. The conversion to the Euro may have competitive implications on the Company's pricing and marketing strategies, the impact of which are not known at this time. Additionally, the Company is at risk to the extent its principal European suppliers and customers are unable to deal effectively with the impact of the Euro conversion. OTHER FACTORS The potential risks associated with the Company's Y2K Plan are discussed above under the heading "Year 2000 Compliance." The majority of the Company's research and development activities, its corporate headquarters, and other critical business operations, including certain major vendors, are located near major seismic faults. The Company's operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected in the event of a major earthquake. Production and marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject the Company to environmental and other regulations including, in some instances, the requirement that the Company provide consumers with the ability to return to the Company product at the end of its useful life, and leave responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling with the Company. Although the Company does not anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, no assurance can be given such laws, or any future laws enacted for the protection of the environment, will not have a material adverse effect on the Company. 25 Because of the foregoing factors, as well as other factors affecting the Company's operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not be considered to be a reliable indicator of future performance, and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods. In addition, the Company's participation in a highly dynamic industry often results in significant volatility of the Company's common stock price. ITEM 7A. DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT To ensure the adequacy and effectiveness of the Company's foreign exchange and interest rate hedge positions, as well as to monitor the risks and opportunities of the nonhedge portfolios, the Company continually monitors its foreign exchange forward and option positions, and its interest rate swap, option and floor positions both on a stand-alone basis and in conjunction with its underlying foreign currency and interest rate related exposures, respectively, from both an accounting and an economic perspective. However, given the effective horizons of the Company's risk management activities and the anticipatory nature of the exposures intended to hedge, there can be no assurance the aforementioned programs will offset more than a portion of the adverse financial impact resulting from unfavorable movements in either foreign exchange or interest rates. In addition, the timing of the accounting for recognition of gains and losses related to mark-to-market instruments for any given period may not coincide with the timing of gains and losses related to the underlying economic exposures and, therefore, may adversely affect the Company's operating results and financial position. INTEREST RATE RISK While the Company is exposed with respect to interest rate fluctuations in many of the world's leading industrialized countries, the Company's interest income and expense is most sensitive to fluctuations in the general level of U.S. interest rates. In this regard, changes in U.S. interest rates affect the interest earned on the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments as well as costs associated with foreign currency hedges. The Company's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the Company's investments and long-term debt obligations and related derivative financial instruments. The Company places its investments with high credit quality issuers and, by policy, limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The Company's general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents; investments with maturities between three and twelve months are considered to be short-term investments. As of September 25, 1999, substantially all of the Company's investments have maturities less than 12 months. During 1996, the Company issued $661 million aggregate principal amount of 6% unsecured convertible subordinated notes (the Notes) to certain qualified parties in a private placement. The Notes were sold at 100% of par. The Notes paid interest semiannually and matured, if not converted earlier, on June 1, 2001. The Notes were convertible by their holders at any time after September 5, 1996, at a conversion price of $29.205 per share subject to adjustments as defined in the Note agreement. No Notes had been converted as of September 25, 1998. The Notes were redeemable by the Company at 102.4% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, for the 12 month period beginning June 1, 1999, and at 101.2% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, for the 12 month period beginning June 1, 2000. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $15 million of costs associated with the issuance of the Notes. These costs were accounted for as a deduction from the face amount of the Notes and were being amortized over the life of the Notes. On April 14, 1999, the Company called for redemption the Notes. Not including approximately $7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs, debentures in an aggregate principal amount outstanding totaled approximately $661 million as of March 27, 1999. During the third quarter of 1999, debenture holders 26 chose to convert virtually all of the outstanding debentures to common stock at a rate of $29.205 per share resulting in the issuance of approximately 22.6 million shares of the Company's common stock. During 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15, 2004. The following table presents the principal (or notional) amounts and related weighted-average interest rates for the Company's investment portfolio and its long-term debt obligations. The long-term debt is comprised of $300 million of unsecured notes described above, which mature in February 2004. The Company's U.S. corporate securities include commercial paper, loan participations, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities include foreign commercial paper, loan participation, certificates of deposit and time deposits with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments have generally been held until maturity. Gross unrealized gains and losses were negligible as of September 25, 1999 and 1998. In millions, except weighted-average interest rates SEPTEMBER 25, 1999 SEPTEMBER 25, 1998 -------------------- -------------------- WEIGHTED- WEIGHTED- AVERAGE AVERAGE CARRYING INTEREST CARRYING INTEREST AMOUNT RATE AMOUNT RATE -------- --------- -------- --------- Assets: Cash equivalents: U.S. Treasury and Agency securities................ $ 3 5.00% $ 10 5.45% U.S. corporate securities.......................... 517 5.16% 785 5.55% Foreign securities................................. 636 4.94% 613 5.55% ------ ------ Total cash equivalents........................... 1,156 5.04% 1,408 5.55% ------ ------ Short-term investments: U.S. Treasury and Agency securities................ $ 298 5.57% $ 0 N/A U.S. corporate securities.......................... 780 5.72% 163 5.56% Foreign securities................................. 822 5.39% 656 5.54% ------ ------ Total short-term investments..................... 1,900 5.55% 819 5.54% ------ ------ Total investment securities.......................... $3,056 5.36% $2,227 5.55% ====== ====== Debt: Fixed rate........................................... $ 300 5.98% $ 954 6.07% ====== ====== Purchased floors are options limiting the Company's exposure to falling interest rates on its cash equivalents and short-term investments by locking in a minimum interest rate. The Company receives a payment when interest rates fall below a predetermined level. A purchased floor generally qualifies for hedge accounting treatment and is reported on the balance sheet at its premium cost, which is amortized over the life of the floor. The purchased floors are generally designated and effective as hedges against interest rate risk on the Company's securities classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value in other current liabilities with the unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Purchased floors outstanding as of September 25, 1998, provided the Company with the option of a weighted-average interest rate of 5.15% on the notional amount of $525 million. There were no purchased floors outstanding as of September 25, 1999. Gains and losses are recognized in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net in the same period as the hedged transaction. Unrealized gains and losses on such contracts were immaterial as of September 25, 1998. 27 During the last two years, the Company has entered into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps and floors, with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The Company does not hold or transact in such financial instruments for purposes other than risk management. The interest rate swaps qualifying as accounting hedges generally require the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively convert the Company's fixed-rate 10 year debt to floating-rate debt and convert the floating rate investments to fixed rate. The maturity date for $25 million of the asset swaps is October 1999 with the remaining debt and asset swaps maturing in February and September of 2001. As of September 25, 1999 and 1998, interest rate debt swaps had a weighted-average receive rate of 6.04%. The weighted-average pay rate on the debt swaps was 5.45% and 5.73% as of September 25, 1999 and 1998, respectively. As of September 25, 1999, interest rate asset swaps had a weighted-average receive rate of 5.53% and a weighted-average pay rate of 5.24%. The unrealized gains and losses on these swaps are deferred and recognized in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net in the same period as the hedged transaction. Deferred losses on such contracts totaled approximately $5 million as of September 25, 1999, while deferred gains on such contracts totaled $7 million as of September 25, 1998. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK Overall, the Company is a net receiver of currencies other than the U.S. dollar and, as such, benefits from a weaker dollar and is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to major currencies worldwide. Accordingly, changes in exchange rates, and in particular a strengthening of the U.S. dollar, may negatively affect the Company's net sales and gross margins as expressed in U.S. dollars. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. The Company's foreign exchange risk management policy requires it to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures that are immaterial either in terms of their minimal U.S. dollar value or in terms of the related currency's historically high correlation with the U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange forward contracts are carried at fair value in other current liabilities. The premium costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in other current assets and marked to market through earnings. Probable but not firmly committed transactions comprise sales of the Company's products and purchases of raw material, sub-assemblies, and assembled finished goods in currencies other than the functional currency. A majority of these transactions are made through the Company's subsidiaries in Europe, Asia (particularly Japan), Canada, and Australia. The Company purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge the currency exchange risks associated with these probable but not firmly committed transactions. The Company also sells foreign exchange option contracts, in order to partially finance the purchase of these foreign exchange option contracts. The term of the Company's foreign exchange hedging instruments, whether for firmly committed transactions, probable but not firmly committed transactions, or to partially finance the foreign risk management program, currently does not extend beyond six months. Gains and losses on accounting hedges of existing assets or liabilities are generally recorded in income or shareholders' equity against the losses and gains on the hedged transactions. Gains and losses related to qualifying accounting hedges of firmly committed or probable but not firmly committed transactions are deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions. Gains and losses on 28 accounting hedges realized before the settlement date of the related hedged transaction are also generally deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions. Gains and losses on interest rate and foreign exchange instruments not accounted for as hedges are recorded in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net. Sold interest rate and foreign exchange instruments do not qualify as accounting hedges. Premiums associated with sold foreign exchange option contracts are marked to market through earnings. The following table provides information about the Company's foreign currency derivative financial instruments outstanding as of September 25, 1999 and 1998. The information is provided in U.S. dollar amounts, as presented in the Company's consolidated financial statements. For foreign currency exchange contracts, the table presents the notional amount (at contract exchange rates) and the weighted-average contractual foreign currency exchange rates. The combined increase in Yen denominated forward contracts and options is the result of increasing net sales in Japan and the substantial appreciation in the Yen 29 during 1999. Generally, all instruments mature within 6 months. Miscellaneous other currencies consist primarily of the Canadian and Australian dollars. 1999 1998 --------------------------- --------------------------- WEIGHTED-AVERAGE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NOTIONAL CONTRACT RATE OR NOTIONAL CONTRACT RATE OR AMOUNT STRIKE PRICE AMOUNT STRIKE PRICE -------- ---------------- -------- ---------------- In millions, except average contract rates and strike prices Foreign currency spot/forward contracts: Japanese Yen.............................. $ 590 105.70 $ 98 139.45 British Pound Sterling.................... 86 1.62 10 1.68 Euro/German Marks......................... 177 1.05 138 1.72 Miscellaneous other currencies............ 62 49 ------ ------ Total currency spot/forward contracts....... $ 915 $ 295 ====== ====== Estimated fair value........................ $ (9) $ (8) ====== ====== Foreign currency purchased call options: Japanese Yen.............................. $ 250 104.80 $ 255 130.22 British Pound Sterling.................... 0 0 75 1.68 Euro/German Marks......................... 105 1.14 180 1.71 Miscellaneous other currencies............ 55 85 ------ ------ Total purchased call options............ $ 410 $ 595 ------ ------ Foreign currency purchased put options: Japanese Yen.............................. $ 860 118.31 $ 525 139.05 British Pound Sterling.................... 75 1.59 205 1.64 Euro/German Marks......................... 505 1.00 450 1.79 Miscellaneous other currencies............ 100 105 ------ ------ Total purchased put options............. $1,540 $1,285 ------ ------ Total foreign currency purchased options.... $1,950 $1,880 ====== ====== Estimated fair value........................ $ 12 $ 22 ====== ====== Foreign currency sold call options: Japanese Yen.............................. $ 290 106.18 $ 240 128.08 British Pound Sterling.................... 25 1.69 150 1.70 Euro/German Marks......................... 120 1.09 110 1.71 Miscellaneous other currencies............ 50 180 ------ ------ Total sold call options................. 485 680 ------ ------ Foreign currency sold put options: Japanese Yen.............................. 0 0 $ 135 145.46 Euro/German Marks......................... $ 75 1.00 $ 25 1.80 Miscellaneous other currencies............ 25 40 ------ ------ Total sold put options.................. 100 200 ------ ------ Total foreign currency sold options......... $ 585 $ 880 ====== ====== Estimated fair value........................ $ (17) $ (15) ====== ====== 30 ITEM 8.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PREPARATION The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. During the first quarter of 1999, the Company amended its by-laws to provide that beginning in 1999 its fiscal year would end on the last Saturday in September rather than the last Friday. Likewise, beginning with the first fiscal quarter of 1999 each of the Company's fiscal quarters now also end on Saturday rather than Friday. Accordingly, one day was added to the first quarter of 1999 so that the quarter ended on Saturday, December 26, 1998. These changes did not have a material effect on the Company's revenue or results of operations for any quarter during fiscal 1999. Fiscal years 1999, 1998 and 1997, each 52-week years, ended on September 25, 25, and 26, respectively. Approximately every six years, the Company reports a 53-week fiscal year to align its fiscal quarters with calendar quarters by adding a week to its first fiscal quarter. The next 53-week year is fiscal 2000. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and accrued liabilities approximate their fair value due to the short maturities of those instruments. INVESTMENTS All highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. Investments with maturities between three and twelve months are considered to be short-term investments. Investments with maturities greater than twelve months are classified as long-term assets. Management determines the appropriate classification of its investments in debt and marketable equity securities at the time of purchase and reevaluates such designation as of each balance sheet date. The Company's debt and marketable equity securities have been classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. These securities are carried at fair value, with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a component of shareholders' equity. These unrealized gains or losses include any unrealized losses and gains on interest rate contracts accounted for as hedges against the available-for-sale securities. The cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK In the ordinary course of business and as part of the Company's asset and liability management, the Company enters into various types of transactions that involve contracts and financial instruments with off-balance-sheet risk. These instruments are entered into in order to manage financial market risk, primarily interest rate and foreign exchange risk. The Company enters into these financial instruments with major international financial institutions utilizing over-the-counter as opposed to exchange traded instruments. The Company does not hold or transact in financial instruments for purposes other than risk management. 37 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) The Company enters into interest rate derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps, collars, and floors, with financial institutions in order to better match the Company's floating-rate interest income on its cash equivalents and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense on its long-term debt, and/or to diversify a portion of the Company's exposure away from fluctuations in short-term U.S. interest rates. The Company may also enter into interest rate contracts that are intended to reduce the cost of the interest rate risk management program. The Company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with financial institutions primarily to protect against currency exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, and probable but not firmly committed transactions. The Company's foreign exchange risk management policy requires it to hedge a majority of its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures that are immaterial either in terms of their minimal U.S. dollar value or in terms of the related currency's historically high correlation with the U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange forward contracts are carried at fair value in other current liabilities. The premium costs of purchased foreign exchange option contracts are recorded in other current assets and amortized over the life of the option. Probable but not firmly committed transactions comprise sales of the Company's products and purchases of raw material, subassemblies, and assembled finished goods in currencies other than the functional currency. A majority of these transactions are made through the Company's subsidiaries in Europe, Asia (particularly Japan), Canada, and Australia. The Company purchases foreign exchange option contracts to hedge the currency exchange risks associated with these probable but not firmly committed transactions. The Company also sells foreign exchange option contracts, in order to partially finance the purchase of these foreign exchange option contracts. The term of the Company's foreign exchange hedging instruments, whether for firmly committed transactions, probable but not firmly committed transactions, or to partially finance the foreign exchange risk management program currently does not extend beyond six months. In addition, the Company has entered into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge certain intercompany loan transactions. These forward contracts effectively change certain foreign currency denominated debt into U.S. dollar denominated debt, which better matches against the Company's U.S. dollar denominated cash equivalents and short-term investments. Interest rate and foreign exchange instruments generally qualify as accounting hedges if their maturity dates are the same as the hedged transactions and if the hedged transactions meet certain requirements. The Company monitors its interest rate and foreign exchange positions on a regular basis based on applicable and commonly used pricing models. The correlation between the changes in the fair value of hedging instruments and the changes in the underlying hedged items is assessed periodically over the life of the hedged instrument. In the event it is determined a hedge is ineffective, including if and when the hedged transactions no longer exists, the Company recognizes in income the change in market value of the instrument beginning on the date it was no longer an effective hedge. Gains and losses on accounting hedges of existing assets or liabilities are generally recorded in income or shareholders' equity against the losses and gains on the hedged transactions. Gains and losses related to qualifying accounting hedges of firmly committed or probable but not firmly committed transactions are deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions. Gains and losses on accounting hedges realized before the settlement date of the related hedged transaction are also generally deferred and recognized in income in the same period as the hedged transactions. 38 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) Gains and losses on interest rate and foreign exchange instruments not accounted for as hedges are recorded in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net. Sold interest rate and foreign exchange instruments do not qualify as accounting hedges. Premiums associated with sold foreign exchange option contracts are marked to market through earnings. INVENTORIES Inventories are stated at the lower of cost (first-in, first-out) or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their market value, provisions are made currently for the difference between the cost and the market value. PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT Property, plant, and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation and amortization are computed by use of the declining balance and straight-line methods over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which are 30 years for buildings, from 2 to 5 years for equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements. LONG-LIVED ASSETS The Company reviews property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of its carrying amount, including the unamortized portion of any allocated goodwill, to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant, and equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets, including any allocated goodwill, exceeds its fair market value. The recoverability of enterprise level goodwill is assessed whenever the facts and circumstances suggest the asset may be impaired. The Company assesses the recoverability of enterprise level goodwill by determining whether the unamortized goodwill balance can be recovered through undiscounted future cash flows. For the three years ended September 25, 1999, the Company has made no adjustments to its long-lived assets except those made in connection with the restructuring actions described in Note 4. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company measures compensation expense for its employee stock-based compensation plans using the intrinsic value method and has provided in Note 7 pro forma disclosures of the effect on net income (loss) and earnings (loss) per share as if the fair value-based method had been applied in measuring compensation expense. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its foreign sales subsidiaries at year-end exchange rates. Gains and losses from these translations are credited or charged to "accumulated translation adjustment" included in "accumulated other comprehensive income (loss)" in shareholders' equity. The Company's foreign manufacturing subsidiaries and certain other entities use the U.S. dollar as the functional currency and translate monetary assets and liabilities at year-end exchange rates, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these translations are included in the Company's results of operations and were not significant in 1999, 1998 or 1997. 39 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) REVENUE RECOGNITION The Company recognizes revenue at the time products are shipped. Provisions are made currently for estimated product returns, price protection, rebates, and other sales programs. Historically, actual amounts recorded for product returns and price protection have not varied significantly from estimated amounts. During 1999, the Company adopted the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement of Position (SOP) 97-2, "Software Revenue Recognition," as modified by SOP 98-9, "Modification of SOP 97-2 With Respect to Certain Transactions". SOP 97-2 establishes standards relating to the recognition of software revenue. SOP 97-2 was effective for transactions entered into by the Company beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 1999. The adoption of SOP 97-2 did not have a material impact on the Company's results of operations. WARRANTY EXPENSE The Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred under product warranties when products are shipped. ADVERTISING COSTS Advertising costs are charged to expense the first time the advertising takes place. Advertising expense was $208 million, $152 million, and $143 million for 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 86, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software to Be Sold, Leased, or Otherwise Marketed," has not materially affected the Company. EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLAN The Company has an employee savings plan (the Savings Plan) qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings Plan, participating U.S. employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the Internal Revenue Service annual contribution limit ($10,000 for calendar year 1999). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee's contributions, depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the employee's earnings. The Company's matching contributions to the Savings Plan were approximately $13 million, $14 million, and $19 million in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE Basic earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings (loss) per common share is computed by dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if the dilutive potential shares of common stock had been issued. The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock method. The dilutive effect of convertible securities is reflected using the if-converted method. 40 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) The following table sets forth the computation of basic and diluted earnings (loss) per share (in thousands, except net income (loss) and per share amounts): FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 25, 1999 SEPTEMBER 25, 1998 SEPTEMBER 26, 1997 - ------------------- ------------------ ------------------ ------------------ Numerator (in millions): Numerator for basic earnings (loss) per share--net income (loss)............... $ 601 $ 309 $ (1,045) Interest expense on convertible debt..... 28 43 -- -------- -------- -------- Numerator for diluted earnings (loss) per share--adjusted net income (loss)...... $ 629 $ 352 $ (1,045) -------- -------- -------- Denominator: Denominator for basic earnings (loss) per share--weighted-average shares outstanding............................ 143,157 131,974 126,062 Effect of dilutive securities: Convertible preferred stock.............. 9,091 9,091 -- Dilutive options......................... 5,819 4,210 -- Convertible debt......................... 16,097 22,642 -- -------- -------- -------- Dilutive potential common shares........... 31,007 35,943 -- -------- -------- -------- Denominator for diluted earnings (loss) per share--adjusted weighted-average shares and assumed conversions.................. 174,164 167,917 126,062 ======== ======== ======== Basic earnings (loss) per share............ $ 4.20 $ 2.34 $ (8.29) ======== ======== ======== Diluted earnings (loss) per share.......... $ 3.61 $ 2.10 $ (8.29) ======== ======== ======== Options to purchase 1.2 million and 6.7 million shares of common stock were outstanding at the end of 1999 and 1998, respectively, that were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because the options' exercise price was greater than the average market price of the Company's common shares for those years and, therefore, the effect would be antidilitive. No options outstanding were included in the calculation of diluted earnings per share for 1997 because the Company had a net loss and to do so would have been antidilutive. COMPREHENSIVE INCOME The Company adopted SFAS No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income," beginning with the Company's first quarter of 1999. SFAS No. 130 separates comprehensive income into two components, net income and other comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue, expenses, gains and losses that under generally accepted accounting principles are recorded as an element of shareholders' equity but are excluded from net income. While SFAS No. 130 establishes new rules for the reporting and display of comprehensive income, it has no impact on the Company's net income (loss) or total shareholders' equity. The Company's other comprehensive income is comprised of foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries not using the U.S. dollar as their functional currency and from unrealized gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as available-for-sale. 41 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED) SEGMENT INFORMATION During 1999, the Company adopted SFAS No. 131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information." SFAS No. 131 supersedes SFAS No. 14, "Financial Reporting for Segments of a Business Enterprise," replacing the "industry segment" approach with the "management" approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company's reportable segments. SFAS No. 131 also requires disclosures about products, major customers, and geographic areas on a company-wide basis. The adoption of SFAS No. 131 did not affect results of operations or the financial position of the Company but did affect the disclosure of segment information. RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS In June 1998, SFAS No. 133, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities," was issued. SFAS No. 133 establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments, hedging activities, and exposure definition. SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending on the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments through earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. In June 1999, SFAS No. 137, "Accounting for Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date of FASB Statement No. 133," was issued. The statement defers the effective date of SFAS No. 133 until the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Although the Company continues to review the effect of the implementation of SFAS No. 133, the Company does not currently believe its adoption will have a material impact on its financial position or overall trends in results of operations and does not believe adoption will result in significant changes to its financial risk management practices. However, the impact of adoption of SFAS No. 133 on the Company's results of operations is dependent upon the fair values of the Company's derivatives and related financial instruments at the date of adoption. In March 1998, the AICPA issued SOP 98-1, "Accounting for the Costs of Computer Software Developed or Obtained for Internal Use," which provides guidance on accounting for the costs of developing computer software intended for internal use. SOP 98-1 must be adopted by the Company effective as of fiscal 2000 and is not expected to have a material impact on the Company's results of operations or financial position. 42 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 2--FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INVESTMENTS The following table summarizes the Company's available-for-sale securities at amortized cost, which approximates fair value, recorded as cash and cash equivalents or short-term investments as of September 25, 1999, and September 25, 1998 (in millions): SEPTEMBER 25, 1999 SEPTEMBER 25, 1998 AMORTIZED COST AMORTIZED COST ------------------ ------------------ U.S. Treasury securities.................... $ 3 $ 10 U.S. corporate securities................... 517 785 Foreign securities.......................... 636 613 ------ ------ Total included in cash and cash equivalents............................. 1,156 1,408 U.S. Treasury securities.................... 298 -- U.S. corporate securities................... 780 163 Foreign securities.......................... 822 656 ------ ------ Total included in short-term investments............................. 1,900 819 ------ ------ Total..................................... $3,056 $2,227 ====== ====== As of September 25, 1999 and 1998, substantially all of the Company's investments had maturities less than twelve months. The Company's U.S. corporate securities include commercial paper and corporate debt securities. Foreign securities include foreign commercial paper, loan participation and certificates of deposit with foreign institutions, most of which are denominated in U.S. dollars. The Company's cash equivalents and short-term investments have generally been held until maturity. Gross unrealized gains and losses were negligible as of September 25, 1999 and 1998. The Company's cash and cash equivalent balances as of September 25, 1999 and 1998, include $4 million and $56 million, respectively, pledged primarily as collateral to support letters of credit. TRADE RECEIVABLES The Company distributes its products principally through third-party computer resellers and various education and consumer channels. The Company generally does not require collateral from its customers. However, when possible the Company does attempt to limit credit risk on trade receivables through the use of flooring arrangements for selected customers with third-party financing companies and credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America and Asia. Although none of the Company's customers accounted for more than 10% of net sales in any of the last three fiscal years, at times considerable trade receivables, which are not covered by collateral, are outstanding with the Company's distribution and retail channel partners. 43 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 2--FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS The following table shows the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's interest rate derivative and foreign currency instruments as of September 25, 1999 and 1998 (in millions). SEPTEMBER 25, 1999 SEPTEMBER 25, 1998 ---------------------------------- ---------------------------------- NOTIONAL FAIR CREDIT RISK NOTIONAL FAIR CREDIT RISK PRINCIPAL VALUE AMOUNTS PRINCIPAL VALUE AMOUNTS --------- -------- ----------- --------- -------- ----------- Transactions qualifying as accounting hedges: Interest rate instruments: Swaps....................................... $ 790 $ (5) $ -- $ 340 $ 7 $ 1 Purchased floors............................ $ -- $ -- $ -- $ 525 $ 1 $ 1 Foreign exchange instruments: Spot/Forward contracts...................... $ 730 $ (8) $ 4 $ 295 $ (8) $ -- Purchased options........................... $1,305 $ 4 $ -- $1,045 $ 14 $ 14 Transactions other than accounting hedges: Foreign exchange instruments: Spot/Forward contracts...................... $ 185 $ (1) $ -- $ -- $ -- $ -- Purchased options........................... $ 645 $ 8 $ 8 $ 835 $ 8 $ 8 Sold options................................ $ 585 $(17) $ -- $ 880 $(15) $ -- The notional principal amounts for off-balance-sheet instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume outstanding as of year-end, and do not represent the amount of the Company's exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amount shown in the table above represents the Company's gross exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency exchange and interest rates at each respective date. The Company's exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as a function of interest rates and currency exchange rates. The estimates of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing models using prevailing financial market information as of September 25, 1999 and 1998. In certain instances where judgment is required in estimating fair value, price quotes were obtained from several of the Company's counterparty financial institutions. Although the table above reflects the notional principal, fair value, and credit risk amounts of the Company's interest rate and foreign exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and transactions that the interest rate and foreign exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the instruments. The interest rate swaps, which qualify as accounting hedges, generally require the Company to pay a floating interest rate based on the three- or six-month U.S. dollar LIBOR and receive a fixed rate of interest without exchanges of the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively convert the Company's fixed-rate 10 year debt to floating-rate debt and convert the floating rate investments to fixed rate. The maturity date for $25 million of the asset swaps is October 1999 with the remaining debt and asset swaps maturing in February and September of 2001. As of September 25, 1999 and 1998, interest rate debt swaps had a weighted-average receive rate of 6.04%. The weighted-average pay rate on the debt swaps was 5.45% and 5.73% as of September 25, 1999 and 1998, respectively. As of September 25, 1999, interest rate asset swaps had a weighted-average receive rate of 5.53% and a weighted-average pay rate of 5.24%. The unrealized gains and losses on these swaps are deferred and recognized in income as a 44 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 2--FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) component of interest and other income (expense), net in the same period as the hedged transaction. Deferred losses on such contracts totaled approximately $5 million as of September 25, 1999, while deferred gains on such contracts totaled $7 million as of September 25, 1998. Purchased floors are options that limit the Company's exposure to falling interest rates on its cash equivalents and short-term investments by locking in a minimum interest rate. The Company receives a payment when interest rates fall below a predetermined level. A purchased floor generally qualifies for hedge accounting treatment and is reported on the balance sheet at its premium cost, which is amortized over the life of the floor. The purchased floors are generally designated and effective as hedges against interest rate risk on the Company's securities classified as available-for-sale and are carried at fair value in other current liabilities with the unrealized gains and losses recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Purchased floors outstanding as of September 25, 1998, provided the Company with the option of a weighted-average interest rate of 5.15% on the notional amount of $525 million. Gains and losses are recognized in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net in the same period as the hedged transaction. Unrealized gains and losses on such contracts were immaterial as of September 25, 1999 and 1998. The foreign exchange forward contracts not accounted for as hedges are carried at fair value in other current liabilities with the gains and losses recorded currently in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net. The foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges are also carried at fair value in other current liabilities with gains and losses recorded currently in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net, against the losses and gains on the hedged transactions. As of September 25, 1999, all foreign exchange forward contracts held by the Company mature within three months. If the option contract is designated and effective as a hedge of a firmly committed transaction, or a probable but not firmly committed transaction, then any gain or loss is deferred until the occurrence of the hedged transaction. Deferred gains and losses on such contracts were not significant as of September 25, 1999 and 1998. If the option contract is used to hedge an asset or liability, then the option is carried at fair value in other current liabilities with the gains and losses recorded currently in income as a component of interest and other income (expense), net, against the losses and gains on the hedged transaction. As of September 25, 1999, maturity dates for purchased foreign exchange option contracts and sold option contracts ranged from one to four months. The counterparties to the agreements relating to the Company's investments and foreign exchange and interest rate instruments consist of a number of major international financial institutions. To date, no such counterparty has failed to meet its financial obligations to the Company. The Company does not believe there is significant risk of nonperformance by these counterparties because the Company continually monitors its positions and the credit ratings of such counterparties, and limits the financial exposure and the number of agreements and contracts it enters into with any one party. The Company generally does not require collateral from counterparties, except for margin agreements associated with the ten-year interest rate swaps on the Company's ten-year unsecured notes. To mitigate the credit risk associated with these ten-year swap transactions, which mature in 2004, the Company entered into margining agreements with its third-party bank counterparties. These agreements require the Company or the counterparty to post margin only if certain credit risk thresholds are exceeded. The amounts held in margin accounts were not significant as of September 25, 1999. 45 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 2--FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) LONG-TERM DEBT The carrying amounts and estimated fair values of the Company's long-term debt are as follows (in millions): SEPTEMBER 25, SEPTEMBER 25, 1999 1998 ------------------- ------------------- CARRYING FAIR CARRYING FAIR AMOUNT VALUE AMOUNT VALUE -------- -------- -------- -------- Ten-year unsecured notes(a)................... $300 $280 $300 $266 Convertible subordinated notes(b)............. $ -- $ -- $661 $887 - ------------------------ (a) The fair value of the ten-year unsecured notes is based on their listed market values as of September 25, 1999 and 1998. (b) The carrying amount of the convertible subordinated notes is prior to consideration of the related issuance costs. Their fair value is reflective of the underlying conversion feature of the Notes. CONVERTIBLE NOTES During 1996, the Company issued $661 million aggregate principal amount of 6% unsecured convertible subordinated notes (the Notes) to certain qualified parties in a private placement. The Notes were sold at 100% of par, paid interest semiannually, and matured on June 1, 2001 if not converted earlier. The Notes were convertible by their holders at any time after September 5, 1996, at a conversion price of $29.205 per share subject to adjustments as defined in the Note agreement. No Notes had been converted as of September 25, 1998. The Notes were redeemable by the Company at 102.4% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, for the twelve month period beginning June 1, 1999, and at 101.2% of the principal amount, plus accrued interest, for the twelve month period beginning June 1, 2000. The Notes were subordinated to all present and future senior indebtedness of the Company as defined in the Note agreement. In addition, the Company incurred approximately $15 million of costs associated with the issuance of the Notes. These costs were accounted for as a deduction from the face amount of the Notes and were being amortized over the life of the Notes. In October 1996, the Company registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) $569 million of the aggregate principal amount of the Notes, including the related shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of these Notes. On April 14, 1999, the Company called for redemption of the Notes. Not including approximately $7 million of unamortized debt issuance costs, debentures in an aggregate principal amount outstanding totaled approximately $661 million as of March 27, 1999. During the third quarter of 1999, debenture holders chose to convert virtually all of the outstanding debentures to common stock at a rate of $29.205 per share resulting in the issuance of approximately 22.6 million shares of the Company's common stock. UNSECURED NOTES During 1994, the Company issued $300 million aggregate principal amount of 6.5% unsecured notes in a public offering registered with the SEC. The notes were sold at 99.925% of par, for an effective yield to maturity of 6.51%. The notes pay interest semiannually and mature on February 15, 2004. EQUITY INVESTMENT AND RELATED GAINS As of September 26, 1997, the Company owned 42.3% of the outstanding stock of ARM Holdings plc (ARM), a privately held company in the United Kingdom involved in the design of high performance microprocessors and related technology. The Company had accounted for this investment using the equity 46 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 2--FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED) method through September 25, 1998. On April 17, 1998, ARM completed an initial public offering of its stock on the London Stock Exchange and the NASDAQ National Market. The Company sold 18.9% of its shares in the offering for a gain before foreign taxes of approximately $24 million, which was recognized as other income. Foreign tax recognized on this gain was approximately $7 million. At the time an equity method investee sells existing or newly issued common stock to unrelated parties in excess of its book value, the equity method requires the net book value of the investment be adjusted to reflect the investor's share of the change in the investee's shareholders' equity resulting from the sale. It is the Company's policy to record an adjustment reflecting its share of the change in the investee's shareholders' equity resulting from such a sale as a gain or loss in other income. Consequently, the Company also recognized in the third quarter of 1998 other income of approximately $16 million to reflect its remaining 25.9% ownership interest in the increased net book value of ARM following its initial public offering. As of September 25, 1998, the carrying value of the Company's investment in ARM carried in other assets in the consolidated balance sheet was approximately $22 million. On October 14, 1998, the Company sold 11.6 million shares (split adjusted) of ARM stock. As a result of this sale, the Company's ownership interest in ARM fell to 19.7%. Consequently, beginning in the first quarter of fiscal 1999, the Company ceased accounting for its remaining investment in ARM using the equity method and categorized its remaining shares as available-for-sale requiring the shares be carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses net of taxes reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. During fiscal 1999, the Company sold a total of approximately 32.6 million shares (split adjusted) of ARM stock for net proceeds of approximately $245 million, recorded a gain before taxes of approximately $230 million, and recognized related income tax of approximately $25 million. As of September 25, 1999, the Company holds 16 million shares of ARM stock valued at $226 million. The fair value of the Company's investment in ARM is reflected in other assets as of September 25, 1999, with an offsetting amount net of $84 million of related deferred taxes recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income. OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS During the fourth quarter of 1999, the Company invested $100 million in Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd (Samsung) to assist in the further expansion of Samsung's TFT-LCD flat-panel display production capacity. The investment is in the form of three year unsecured bonds, which is convertible into approximately 550,000 shares of Samsung common stock beginning in June 2000. The bonds carry an annual coupon rate of 2% and pay a total yield to maturity of 5% if redeemed at their maturity. In June 1999, the Company invested $12.5 million in Akamai Technologies, Inc. (Akamai), a global Internet content delivery service. The investment, in the form of convertible preferred stock, is convertible into 4.1 million shares of Akamai common stock (adjusted for subsequent stock splits). The Company is restricted from selling more than 25% of its shares within one year after the date of the closing of a public offering of Akamai's stock. 47 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 3--CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT DETAILS INVENTORIES (in millions) 1999 1998 -------- -------- Purchased parts............................................. $ 4 $32 Work in process............................................. 3 5 Finished goods.............................................. 13 41 --- --- Total inventories........................................... $20 $78 === === PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT (in millions) 1999 1998 -------- -------- Land and buildings.......................................... $323 $338 Machinery and equipment..................................... 220 277 Office furniture and equipment.............................. 61 80 Leasehold improvements...................................... 125 129 ---- ---- 729 824 Accumulated depreciation and amortization...................

The restructuring plan was necessitated by decreased demand for the Company's products and the Company's adoption of a new strategic direction. These actions resulted in a charge during 1996 of $179 million. During 1997, the Company announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring actions to meet the foregoing objectives of the plan. The Company recognized a $217 million charge during 1997 for the estimated incremental costs of those actions. All material restructuring actions contemplated under the plan were essentially complete at the end of fiscal 1998. The combined 1996 and 1997 restructuring actions consisted of terminating approximately 4,200 full-time employees; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a result of those employee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings, and equipment to be sold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing various operational functions; and canceling contracts for projects and technologies that were not critical to the Company's core business strategy. The restructuring actions under the plan resulted in cash expenditures of $293 million and noncash asset write-downs of $95 million from the second quarter of 1996 through September 25, 1999. Of the combined 1996 and 1997 restructuring charges of $396 million, approximately $3 million was determined to be excess during the fourth quarter of 1999 and was reversed. The remaining balance of $5 million as of September 25, 1999 is comprised of payments over the next two years on leases and contracts that had been terminated prior to fiscal 1999. The Company expects the remaining accrual will result in cash expenditures of $5 million over the next two years. The following table depicts the restructuring activity through September 25, 1999, associated with the 1996 and 1997 restructuring actions described above (in millions): PAYMENTS TO EMPLOYEES PAYMENTS ON WRITE-DOWN OF PAYMENTS ON INVOLUNTARILY CANCELED FACILITY OPERATING ASSETS CANCELED TERMINATED(A) LEASES (A) TO BE SOLD (B) CONTRACTS (A) TOTAL ------------- ----------------- ---------------- ------------- -------- Net Additions during 1996...... $ 81 $ 19 $ 54 $ 25 $ 179 Spending during 1996...........

The net restructuring charge of $18 million recognized during the fourth quarter of 1999 reflects the $3 million of excess reserves related to the 1996 and 1997 restructuring actions. The total cost of these actions of $21 million, which is comprised of $11 million for contract cancellation charges associated with the closure of the Company's outsourced data center and $10 million for contract cancellation charges related to supply and development agreements previously discontinued. The Company expects these actions to result in cash expenditures of $21 million over the next year. During the second quarter of 1999, the Company took certain actions to improve the flexibility and efficiency of its manufacturing operations by moving final assembly of certain of its products to third-party manufacturers. These restructuring actions resulted in the Company recognizing a charge to operations of approximately $9 million during the second quarter of 1999, which was comprised of $6 million for severance benefits to be paid to employees involuntarily terminated, $2 million for the write-down of operating assets to be disposed of, and $1 million for payments on canceled contracts. These actions resulted in the termination of approximately 580 employees and are substantially complete as of September 25, 1999. TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION In May 1998, the Company acquired certain technology that was under development and had no alternative future use. The acquisition resulted in the recognition of $7 million of purchased in-process research and development, which was charged to operations upon acquisition. TERMINATION OF LICENSE AGREEMENT In August 1997, the Company agreed to acquire certain assets of Power Computing Corporation (PCC), a licensed distributor of the Mac OS operating system, including PCC's customer database and its license to distribute the Mac OS. The agreement with PCC also included a release of claims between the parties. On January 28, 1998, the Company completed its acquisition of certain assets from PCC. The total purchase price was approximately $110 million, of which $75 million was expensed in the fourth quarter of 1997 as "termination of license agreement" and $35 million was recorded as goodwill in the second quarter of 1998. The goodwill is being amortized over three years. The purchase price was comprised of approximately 4.2 million shares of the Company's common stock valued at $80 million, forgiveness of $28 million of receivables due from PCC, and assumption by the Company of $2 million of certain customer support liabilities of PCC. NEXT ACQUISITION On February 4, 1997, the Company acquired all of the outstanding shares of NeXT Software, Inc. (NeXT). NeXT, headquartered in Redwood City, California, had developed, marketed and supported software enabling customers to implement business applications on the Internet/World Wide Web, intranets and enterprise-wide client/server networks. The total purchase price was $427 million and was comprised of cash payments of $319 million and the issuance of 1.5 million shares of the Company's common stock to the NeXT shareholders valued at approximately $25 million according to the terms of the purchase agreement; the issuance of approximately 1.9 million options to purchase the Company's common stock to the NeXT optionholders valued at approximately $16 million; cash payments of $56 million to the NeXT debtholders; cash payments of $9 million for closing and related costs, and $2 million of net liabilities assumed. The acquisition was accounted for as a purchase; and, accordingly, the operating results 50 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 4--SPECIAL CHARGES (CONTINUED) pertaining to NeXT subsequent to the date of acquisition have been included in the Company's operating results. The total purchase price was allocated to purchased in-process research and development ($375 million) and to goodwill and other intangible assets ($52 million). The purchased in-process research and development was charged to operations upon acquisition, and the goodwill and other intangible assets are being amortized on a straight-line basis over two to three years. NOTE 5--INCOME TAXES The provision for income taxes consisted of the following (in millions): 1999 1998 1997 -------- --------- --------- Federal: Current.................................................. $ 4 $ -- $ -- Deferred................................................. 30 -- -- --- --------- --------- 34 -- -- --- --------- --------- State: Current.................................................. -- -- -- Deferred................................................. 11 -- -- --- --------- --------- 11 -- -- --- --------- --------- Foreign: Current.................................................. 33 11 -- Deferred................................................. (3) 9 -- --- --------- --------- 30 20 -- --- --------- --------- Provision for income taxes................................. $75 $ 20 $ -- === ========= ========= The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings (loss) of approximately $612 million, $315 million, and $(265) million in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. A substantial portion of the Company's cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments is held by foreign subsidiaries and is generally based in U.S. dollar-denominated holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries would be subject to U.S. income taxation on repatriation to the United States. The Company's consolidated financial statements fully provide for any related tax liability on amounts that may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of the Company's foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the United States. U.S. income taxes have not been provided on a cumulative total of $520 million of such earnings. It is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that might be incurred if these earnings were to be distributed. Except for such indefinitely reinvested earnings, the Company provides for federal and state income taxes currently on undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries. Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. 51 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 5--INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED) As of September 25, 1999 and 1998, the significant components of the Company's deferred tax assets and liabilities were (in millions): 1999 1998 -------- -------- Deferred tax assets: Accounts receivable and inventory reserves................ $ 31 $ 87 Accrued liabilities and other reserves.................... 77 83 Basis of capital assets and investments................... 67 71 Tax losses and credits.................................... 438 447 ---- ---- Total deferred tax assets................................. 613 688 Less valuation allowance.................................... 60 213 ---- ---- Net deferred tax assets..................................... 553 475 ---- ---- Deferred tax liabilities: Unremitted earnings of subsidiaries....................... 442 390 Available-for-sale securities............................. 84 -- Other..................................................... 12 20 ---- ---- Total deferred tax liabilities............................ 538 410 ---- ---- Net deferred tax asset...................................... $ 15 $ 65 ==== ==== As of September 25, 1999, the Company had operating loss carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately $414 million, which expire principally in 2011 and 2012. This does not include approximately $102 million of remaining operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT, which expire in 2008 - 2012, and the utilization of which is subject to certain limitations imposed by the Internal Revenue Code. The Company also has various state and foreign tax loss and credit carryforwards, the tax effect of which is approximately $90 million and which expire between 2001 and 2014. Most of the remaining benefits from tax losses and credits do not expire. As of September 25, 1999, a valuation allowance of $60 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the benefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates to the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and to tax benefits in certain foreign jurisdictions. The net change in the total valuation allowance in 1999 was a decrease of $153 million. Management believes it is more likely than not forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result of certain tax planning strategies, will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining net deferred tax assets. 52 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 5--INCOME TAXES (CONTINUED) A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in 1999, 1998, and 1997) to income (loss) before provision for income taxes, is as follows (in millions): 1999 1998 1997 -------- -------- -------- Computed expected tax (benefit)........................ $ 236 $115 $(366) State taxes, net of federal effect..................... 12 10 (3) Indefinitely invested earnings of foreign subsidiaries.........................................

The Company contested the proposed deficiencies by filing petitions with the United States Tax Court, and most of the issues in dispute have now been resolved. On June 30, 1997, the IRS proposed income tax adjustments for the years 1992 through 1994. Although most of the issues for these years have been resolved, certain issues still remain in dispute and are being contested by the Company. Management believes adequate provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax examinations. NOTE 6--SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN In July 1999, the Company's Board of Directors authorized a plan for the Company to repurchase up to $500 million of its common stock. This repurchase plan does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific number of shares or acquire shares over any specified period of time. As of September 25, 1999, the Company had repurchased a total of 1.25 million shares of its common stock at a cost of $75 million. PREFERRED STOCK In August 1997, the Company and Microsoft Corporation (Microsoft) entered into patent cross licensing and technology agreements. In addition, Microsoft purchased 150,000 shares of Apple Series A nonvoting convertible preferred stock ("preferred stock") for $150 million. Except under limited circumstances, the shares of preferred stock may not be sold by Microsoft prior to August 5, 2000. Upon any sale of the preferred stock by Microsoft, the shares will automatically be converted into shares of Apple common stock at a conversion price of $16.50 per share, and the shares can be converted at Microsoft's option at such price after August 5, 2000. Each share of preferred stock is entitled to receive, if and when declared by the Company's Board of Directors, a dividend of $30.00 per share per annum, payable in preference to any dividend on the Company's common stock. Additionally, if the dividends per share paid on the common stock are greater than the dividends per share paid on the preferred stock on an "as if converted" basis, then the Board of Directors shall declare an additional dividend such that the dividends per share paid on the preferred stock on an "as if converted" basis, shall equal the dividends per share paid on the common stock. 53 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 6--SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (CONTINUED) 1998 EXECUTIVE OFFICER STOCK PLAN The Company has in effect a 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan (the 1998 Plan), which replaced the 1990 Stock Option Plan terminated in April 1998, the 1981 Stock Option Plan terminated in October 1990, and the 1987 Executive Long Term Stock Option Plan terminated in July 1995. Options granted before these plans' termination dates remain outstanding in accordance with their terms. Options may be granted under the 1998 Plan to the Chairman of the Board of Directors, executive officers of the Company at the level of Senior Vice President and above, and other key employees. These options generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, and generally expire 10 years after the grant date. The 1998 Plan permits the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, stock appreciation rights, and stock purchase rights. A total of 17,000,000 shares have been authorized for issuance under the 1998 Plan, of which 12,038,390 shares are reserved for future issuance as of September 25, 1999. 1997 EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the 1997 Plan), for grants of stock options to employees who are not officers of the Company. Options may be granted under the 1997 Plan to employees at not less than the fair market value on the date of grant. These options generally become exercisable over a period of 4 years, based on continued employment, and generally expire 10 years after the grant date. A total of 18,000,000 shares have been authorized for issuance under the 1997 Plan, of which 8,605,065 shares are reserved for future issuance as of September 25, 1999. 1997 DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN In August 1997, the Company's Board of Directors approved a Director Stock Option Plan (DSOP), for which directors of the Company are eligible. Options granted under the DSOP vest in three equal installments, on each of the first through third anniversaries of the date of grant. A total of 400,000 shares have been authorized for issuance under the DSOP, of which 220,000 shares remain reserved for future issuance. Supplementally and separate from the DSOP, 30,000 options had been granted in total to two members of the Company's Board of Directors, and were outstanding as of September 25, 1999. EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN The Company has an employee stock purchase plan (the Purchase Plan), under which substantially all employees may purchase common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market values as of the beginning and end of the six-month offering period. Stock purchases under the Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of an employee's compensation, up to a maximum of $25,000 in any calendar year. During 1999 and 1998, 540,000 and 1.1 million shares, respectively, were issued under the Purchase Plan. As of September 25, 1999, approximately 2.96 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase Plan. SENIOR OFFICERS RESTRICTED PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN In November 1997, the Company's Board of Directors issued approximately 24,000 fully vested shares and cash in settlement of shares to certain officers of the Company under the Senior Officers Restricted Performance Share Plan (the PSP) based upon the achievement of certain performance goals established in advance by the Compensation Committee of the Board. Immediately after these shares were issued, the Company's Board of Directors terminated the PSP. 54 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 6--SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (CONTINUED) SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN In May 1989, the Company adopted a shareholder rights plan and distributed a dividend of one right to purchase one share of common stock (a Right) for each outstanding share of common stock of the Company. The Rights would have become exercisable in certain limited circumstances involving a potential business combination transaction of the Company and would have become initially exercisable at a price of $200 per share. Following certain other events after the Rights had become exercisable, each Right would have entitled its holder to purchase for $200 an amount of common stock of the Company, or, in certain circumstances, securities of the acquiror, having a then-current market value of two times the exercise price of the Right. The Rights expired on April 19, 1999. STOCK OPTION ACTIVITY A summary of the Company's stock option activity and related information for the years ended September 25, 1999 and 1998, and September 26, 1997, follows (option amounts are presented in thousands): YEAR ENDED YEAR ENDED YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 25, 1999 SEPTEMBER 25, 1998 SEPTEMBER 26, 1997 ------------------------- ------------------------- ------------------------- NUMBER WEIGHTED- NUMBER WEIGHTED- NUMBER WEIGHTED- OF AVERAGE OF AVERAGE OF AVERAGE OPTIONS EXERCISE PRICE OPTIONS EXERCISE PRICE OPTIONS EXERCISE PRICE -------- -------------- -------- -------------- -------- -------------- Options outstanding--beginning of year.............................. 18,694 $20.47 18,649 $17.24 14,112 $27.23 Granted (price equals FMV)........ 5,955 $38.87 13,879 $23.11 20,629 $16.91 Granted (price less than FMV)..... -- $ -- -- $ -- 1,853 $ 6.54 Exercised.........................

The options outstanding as of September 25, 1999, have been segregated into five ranges for additional disclosure as follows (option amounts are presented in thousands): OPTIONS OUTSTANDING OPTIONS EXERCISABLE ----------------------------------------------- ---------------------------- WEIGHTED- OPTIONS AVERAGE WEIGHTED OPTIONS WEIGHTED OUTSTANDING AS OF REMAINING AVERAGE EXERCISABLE AS OF AVERAGE SEPTEMBER 25, CONTRACTUAL LIFE EXERCISE SEPTEMBER 25, EXERCISE 1999 IN YEARS PRICE 1999 PRICE ----------------- ---------------- -------- ----------------- -------- $1.66-$13.25................... 3,296 7.68 $12.54 1,324 $12.16 $13.26-$19.75.................. 4,449 8.20 $14.95 477 $16.31 $19.76-$31.19.................. 3,446 8.79 $30.07 705 $28.99 $31.20-$34.63.................. 4,149 9.23 $34.41 81 $34.18 $34.64-$79.06.................. 3,064 9.48 $42.92 146 $36.01 ------ ----- $1.66-$79.06................... 18,404 8.66 $26.39 2,733 $19.15 ====== ===== As of September 25, 1999, approximately 20.9 million options were reserved for future grant under the Company's stock option plans. 55 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 6--SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (CONTINUED) In December 1997, the Board of Directors approved an option exchange program allowing employees to exchange all (but not less than all) of their existing options (vested and unvested) with an exercise price greater than $13.6875, on a one-for-one basis for new options with an exercise price of $13.6875, the fair market value of the Company's common stock on December 19, 1997, and a new four year vesting schedule beginning in December 1997. A total of 4.7 million options with a weighted-average exercise price of $19.90 per share were exchanged for new options as a result of this program. In July 1997, the Board of Directors approved an option exchange program allowing employees to exchange all (but not less than all) of their existing options (vested and unvested) to purchase Apple common stock (other than options granted and assumed from NeXT) for options having an exercise price of $13.25 and a new three year vesting period beginning in July of 1997. Approximately 7.9 million options were repriced under this program. NOTE 7--STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board (APB) Opinion No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees," and related interpretations in accounting for its employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares because, as discussed below, the alternative fair value accounting provided for under SFAS No. 123 requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. Under APB Opinion No. 25, when the exercise price of the Company's employee stock options equals the market price of the underlying stock on the date of the grant, no compensation expense is recognized. Pro forma information regarding net income (loss) per share is required by SFAS No. 123 and has been determined as if the Company had accounted for its employee stock options granted and employee stock purchase plan purchases subsequent to September 29, 1995, under the fair value method of that statement. The fair values for these options and stock purchases were estimated at the date of grant and beginning of the period, respectively, using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during 1998 and 1997 includes the excess value of the repriced options granted during those fiscal years less the value of the related forfeited options on the date the repriced options were granted. The assumptions used for each of the last three fiscal years and the resulting estimate of weighted-average fair value per share of options granted during those years are as follows: 1999 1998 1997 --------- --------- --------- Expected life of options.................... 4 years 3.5 years 3 years Expected life of stock purchases............ 6 months 6 months 6 months Interest rate--stock options................ 5.02% 5.54% 6.3% Interest rate--stock purchases.............. 4.89% 5.37% 5.3% Volatility--stock options................... 55% 78% 74% Volatility--stock purchases................. 59% 56% 52% Dividend yields............................. 0 0 0 Weighted-average fair value of options granted during the year................... $19.22 $12.98 $7.49 The Black-Scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable. In addition, option valuation models require the input of highly subjective assumptions including the expected stock price volatility. Because the 56 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 7--STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION (CONTINUED) Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options, and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate, in management's opinion, the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of the Company's employee stock options and employee stock purchase plan shares. For purposes of pro forma disclosures, the estimated fair value of the options and shares are amortized to pro forma net income (loss) over the options' vesting period and the shares' plan period. The value of the options granted to NeXT optionholders in 1997 has been included in the total purchase price paid for NeXT and, therefore, is not included in the adjustment to arrive at the pro forma net loss. The Company's pro forma information for each of the last three fiscal years follows (in millions, except per share amounts): 1999 1998 1997 -------- -------- -------- Net income (loss)--as reported....................... $ 601 $ 309 $(1,045) Net income (loss)--pro forma......................... $ 528 $ 266 $(1,082) Net income (loss) per common share--as reported Basic.............................................. $4.20 $2.34 $ (8.29) Diluted............................................ $3.61 $2.10 $ (8.29) Net income (loss) per common share--pro forma Basic.............................................. $3.69 $2.02 $ (8.58) Diluted............................................ $3.25 $1.83 $ (8.58) As SFAS No. 123 is applicable only to options granted or shares issued subsequent to September 29, 1995, its pro forma effect was not fully reflected until 1999. NOTE 8--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES LEASE COMMITMENTS The Company leases various facilities and equipment under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The major facilities leases are for terms of 5 to 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms of up to 5 additional years. Rent expense under all operating leases was approximately $61 million, $63 million, and $106 million in 1999, 1998, and 1997, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as of September 25, 1999, are as follows (in millions): FISCAL YEARS - ------------ 2000........................................................ $ 46 2001........................................................ 41 2002........................................................ 29 2003........................................................ 19 2004........................................................ 14 Later years................................................. 35 ---- Total minimum lease payments................................ $184 ==== 57 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 8--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED) CONCENTRATIONS IN THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCT Although certain components essential to the Company's business are generally available from multiple sources, other key components (including microprocessors and application-specific integrated circuits, or "ASICs") are currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources. If the supply of a key single-sourced component to the Company were to be delayed or curtailed or in the event a key manufacturing vendor delays shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company's ability to ship related products in desired quantities and in a timely manner could be adversely affected. The Company's business and financial performance could also be adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative source. In addition, the Company uses some components that are not common to the rest of the personal computer industry. Continued availability of these components may be affected if producers were to decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of components customized to meet the Company's requirements. Finally, significant portions of the Company's CPUs, logic boards, and assembled products are now manufactured by outsourcing partners. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules and levels, the Company's operating results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production obligations. LITIGATION ABRAHAM AND EVELYN KOSTICK TRUST V. PETER CRISP ET AL. In January 1996, a purported shareholder derivative action was filed in the California Superior Court for Santa Clara County naming the Company and its then directors as defendants, seeking injunctive relief and damages for alleged acts of mismanagement. Between February 1996 and October 1997, the complaint was amended several times as a result of the Courts' rulings upon various demurrers filed by the Company. The Third Amended Complaint was filed in October 1997, and eliminated the class action claims and restated claims against certain directors and former directors. In November 1997, the Company's Board of Directors appointed a special investigation committee and engaged independent counsel to assist in the investigation of the claims made in the Third Amended Complaint. This matter was settled during the fourth quarter of 1999 for an amount not material to the Company's financial position or results of operations. LS MEN'S CLOTHING DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION FUND V. MICHAEL SPINDLER ET AL. In May 1996, an action was filed in the California Superior Court naming as defendants the Company and certain of its current and former officers and directors and seeking compensatory and punitive damages for alleged misrepresentation and omission of material facts about the Company's operations and financial results. Between May 1996 and November 1997, the complaint was has been amended several times as a result of the Court's rulings upon various demurrers of the Company. In January 1998, the Company and three individual defendants brought a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint, and, in March 1998, the Court granted the motion to dismiss the third amended complaint without leave to amend. The plaintiffs filed an appeal in the Sixth Appellate District in June 1998. The Court of Appeal heard oral argument in November 1999 and has not yet ruled. "REPETITIVE STRESS INJURY" LITIGATION The Company was named in approximately 60 lawsuits between 1991 to 1995, alleging plaintiffs incurred so-called "repetitive stress" injuries to their upper extremities as a result of using keyboards and/or mouse input devices sold by the Company. These actions are similar to those filed against other major suppliers of 58 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 8--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED) personal computers. All but three of the cases against the Company were dismissed by the end of fiscal 1998. During fiscal 1999, the remaining three cases were dismissed. MONITOR-SIZE LITIGATION In August 1995, the Company was named, along with 41 other entities, including computer manufacturers and computer monitor vendors, in a putative nationwide class action filed in the California Superior Court for Orange County, styled Keith Long et al. v. Amazing Technologies Corp. et al. The complaint alleges each of the defendants engaged in false or misleading advertising with respect to the size of computer monitor screens. Also in August 1995, the Company was named as the sole defendant in a purported class action alleging similar claims filed in the New Jersey Superior Court for Camden County, entitled Mahendri Shah v. Apple Computer, Inc. Subsequently, in November 1995, the Company, along with 26 other entities, was named in a purported class action alleging similar claims filed in the New Jersey Superior Court for Essex County, entitled Maizes & Maizes v. Apple Computer, Inc. et al.. The complaints in all of these cases seek restitution in the form of refunds or product exchange, damages, punitive damages, and attorneys fees. In December 1995, the California Judicial Council ordered all of the California actions, including Long, coordinated for purposes of pretrial proceedings and trial before a single judge. These actions were subsequently coordinated under the name In re Computer Monitor Litigation. In July 1996, the Court ordered all of the California cases dismissed without leave to amend as to plaintiffs residing in California. In March 1998, the Court granted final approval of a settlement resolving all claims and all subsequent appeals have been dismissed. EXPONENTIAL TECHNOLOGY INC. V. APPLE COMPUTER, INC. Plaintiff, Exponential Technology, Inc. (Exponential), alleged the Company, which was an investor in Exponential, breached its fiduciary duty to Exponential by misusing confidential information and that the Company fraudulently misrepresented the facts about allowing Exponential to sell its processors to the Company's Mac OS licensees. The lawsuit was filed in California Superior Court for Santa Clara County. In November 1997, the Company filed a demurrer to portions of the complaint, which the Court granted in part. In January 1998, the plaintiff filed an Amended Complaint. In March 1998, the Company filed a cross-complaint for damages against Exponential alleging breach of contract, negligent misrepresentation, and violations of the California Corporations Code. This matter was settled during the fourth quarter of 1999 for an amount not material to the Company's financial position or results of operations. FTC INQUIRY--PRADO V. APPLE COMPUTER, INC. (AND RELATED ACTIONS) In October 1997, Apple began charging all U.S. noneducation customers for live telephone technical support beyond 90 days after purchase of Apple products. In late 1997, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commenced an investigation into customer complaints that Apple's change in technical support practices was either unfair or contrary to earlier representations to certain customers. Four purported class action lawsuits were filed against Apple related to this change. During the fourth quarter of 1999, the regional and national offices of the FTC approved a settlement with the Company, and a settlement was approved by the Court in three of the class action suits. In November 1999, two appeals were filed objecting to the settlement and therefore the settlement is stayed pending resolution of the appeals. Settlement of these matters was not material to the Company's financial position or results of operations. MICROWARE SYSTEMS CORPORATION V. APPLE COMPUTER, INC. Plaintiff, Microware Systems Corporation (Microware), filed this action against the Company on September 1, 1999, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa. Microware alleges that 59 NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED) NOTE 8--COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED) the Company's current release of its Mac OS operating system, Mac OS 9, infringes Microware's trademark for its real time operating system, OS-9. Microware asserts claims for trademark infringement, false designation of origin, dilution and common law trademark infringement and unfair competition. On October 14, 1999, Microware filed a motion for preliminary injunction seeking to enjoin the Company from using the designation "Mac OS 9" and to order the Company to cancel and withdraw all packaging and advertisements that mention "Mac OS 9."

ARRANGEMENTS WITH NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS The Company entered into an employment agreement with Mr. Anderson effective April 1, 1996, pursuant to which he serves as Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company. Pursuant to his agreement, Mr. Anderson is entitled to an annual base salary of no less than $500,000. If Mr. Anderson's employment is terminated by the Company without "Cause" at any time during the five-year period following April 1, 1996, he will be entitled to receive a lump sum severance payment equal to the sum of his annual base salary and target bonus, if any. Mr. Anderson's agreement generally defines 71 "Cause" to include a felony conviction, willful disclosure of confidential information or willful and continued failure to perform his employment duties. In February 1998, Mr. Cook joined the Company as Senior Vice President, Worldwide Operations. Under the terms of his employment, he is entitled to an annual base salary of no less than $400,000. In addition, Mr. Cook received a one-time hiring bonus in the amount of $500,000 and a stock option grant with a sell-back provision. The sell-back provision provides that during the five-day period starting on the second anniversary of his commencement of employment, he may elect to sell all of his remaining vested and unvested options and shares (obtained through the exercise of such options) back to the Company for the sum of $3 million less any profits Mr. Cook has realized to date through the exercise and sale of such options (the "Sell-back Option"). During fiscal 1999, Mr. Cook realized net profits from the exercise and sale of his options in excess of $3 million. The Sell-back Option has no future effect. If Mr. Cook's employment is terminated by the Company without "Cause" during the first two years of his employment, he will be entitled to receive an amount equal to $800,000 minus the total base salary he has received since the start of his employment. CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS--STOCK OPTIONS In the event of a "change in control" of the Company, all outstanding options under the Company's stock option plans, except the Director Stock Option Plan, will, unless otherwise determined by the plan administrator, become exercisable in full, and will be cashed out at an amount equal to the difference between the applicable "change in control price" and the exercise price. The Director Stock Option Plan provides that upon a "change in control" of the Company, all unvested options held by non-employee directors will automatically become fully vested and exercisable and will be cashed out at an amount equal to the difference between the applicable "change in control price" and the exercise price of the options. A "change in control" under these plans is generally defined as (i) the acquisition by any person of 50% or more of the combined voting power of the Company's outstanding securities or (ii) the occurrence of a transaction requiring shareholder approval and involving the sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company or the merger of the Company with or into another corporation. In addition, options granted to Timothy D. Cook, Nancy R. Heinen, Mitchell Mandich and Sina Tamaddon provide that in the event there is a "change in control", as defined in the Company's stock option plans, and if in connection with or following such "change in control", their employment is terminated without "Cause" or if they should resign for "Good Reason", those options outstanding that are not yet vested and exercisable as of the date of such "change in control", shall become fully vested and exercisable. Generally, "Cause" is defined to include a felony conviction, willful disclosure of confidential information or willful and continued failure to perform his or her employment duties. "Good Reason" includes resignation of employment as a result of a substantial diminution in position or duties, or an adverse change in title or reduction in annual base salary. CHANGE IN CONTROL ARRANGEMENTS--RETENTION AGREEMENTS The Company was a party to retention agreements (the "RETENTION AGREEMENTS") with three executive officers (Messrs. Anderson, Rubinstein and Tevanian) providing for certain cash payments in the event of a termination of employment following a change in control of the Company. In March, 1999, Messrs. Anderson, Rubinstein and Tevanian agreed to waive any rights they may have under the Retention Agreements. In exchange, all options previously granted to Messrs. Anderson, Rubinstein and Tevanian were amended to include a "change in control" provision similar to the provision contained in option grants to Messrs. Cook, Mandich, Tamaddon and Ms. Heinen. 72 CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND RELATED TRANSACTIONS In connection with the Company's use of aircraft to transport its executive officers, the Company paid approximately $102,865 during fiscal year 1999 to Wing & A Prayer, a company wholly-owned by Lawrence J. Ellison. 73 REPORT OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION The Company's executive compensation program is administered by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors (the "COMMITTEE"). The role of the Committee, which is comprised of two outside non-employee directors, is to review and approve the base salaries, bonuses, stock options and other compensation of the executive officers and management-level employees of the Company. The Committee also administers the Company's stock option plans and makes grants to executive officers under the 1998 Executive Officer Stock Plan (the "1998 Plan"). The Company's executive compensation program utilizes Company performance, individual performance and an increase in stockholder value over time as determinants of executive pay levels. These principles are intended to motivate executive officers to improve the financial position of the Company, to hold executives accountable for the performance of the organizations for which they are responsible, to attract key executives into the service of the Company and to create value for the Company's shareholders. The compensation for executive officers is based on two elements: Cash compensation and equity-based compensation. CASH COMPENSATION The Company reviews executive compensation surveys in both the computer industry and general industry to ensure that the total cash compensation provided to executive officers and senior management remains at a competitive level to enable the Company to attract and retain management personnel with the talents and skills required to meet the challenges of a highly competitive industry. The compensation of executive officers, other than Mr. Jobs, interim Chief Executive Officer, is reviewed annually by the Committee. BONUSES For fiscal year 1999, the Compensation Committee approved the FY99 Vice Presidents and Directors Incentive Bonus Plan (the "BONUS PLAN"), under which cash bonuses for employees at the level of director and above were determined based on specified revenue, unit shipments and profit targets for the Company. Because the Company did not achieve the metrics specified in the Bonus Plan, no payments were made thereunder. Executive officers and members of the Board of Directors are not eligible to participate in the Bonus Plan. EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION In fiscal year 1999, the Compensation Committee emphasized equity-based compensation, principally in the form of options, as the cornerstone of the Company's executive compensation program. Equity awards are typically set by the Compensation Committee based on industry surveys, each officer's individual performance and achievements, market factors and the recommendations of management. In fiscal year 1999, executive officers were eligible to receive grants of stock options under the 1998 Plan. In addition, executive officers were eligible to participate in the Company's Employee Stock Purchase Plan. During fiscal year 1999, all of the executive officers of the Company received new option grants under the 1998 Plan. The Options granted under the 1998 Plan were at an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the Common Stock on the date of grant and generally vest in unequal increments over a five-year period after grant, subject to the participant's continued employment with the Company. All options granted under the 1998 Plan expire ten years from the date of grant, unless a shorter term is provided in the option agreement or the participant's employment with the Company ends before the end of such ten-year period. COMPENSATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER Mr. Jobs, the Company's interim Chief Executive Officer, received $1 for the services he performed for the Company in fiscal year 1999. 74 SECTION 162(m) The Company intends that options granted under the Company's stock option plans be deductible by the Company under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.
