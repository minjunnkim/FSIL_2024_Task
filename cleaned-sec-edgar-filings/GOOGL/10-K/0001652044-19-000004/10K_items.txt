Various events outside our control pose threat our intellectual property rights, well our products, services and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not available every country which our products and services are distributed made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts have taken protect our proprietary rights may not sufficient effective. Although seek obtain patent protection for our innovations, possible may not able protect some these innovations. Moreover, may not have adequate patent copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out important. Furthermore, there always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope the protection gained will insufficient that issued patent may deemed invalid unenforceable. also seek maintain certain intellectual property trade secrets. The secrecy such trade secrets and other sensitive information could compromised outside parties, our employees, which could cause lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there risk that the word “Google” could become commonly used that becomes synonymous with the word “search.” Some courts have ruled that "Google" protectable trademark, however possible that other courts, particularly those outside the United States, may reach different determination. this happens, could lose protection for this trademark, which could result other people using the word “Google” refer their own products, thus diminishing our brand. Any significant impairment our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights costly and time consuming. Any increase the unauthorized use our intellectual property could make more expensive business and harm our operating results. Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that may adversely affect our business and results operations. Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and divestitures are important elements our overall corporate strategy and use capital, and these transactions could material our financial condition and results operations. expect continue evaluate and enter into discussions regarding wide array potential strategic transactions. Effecting these strategic transactions could create unforeseen operating difficulties and expenditures. The areas where face risks include, among others: • Diversion management time and focus from operating our business challenges related acquisitions and other strategic transactions. • Failure successfully further develop the acquired business technology. • Implementation remediation controls, procedures, and policies the acquired company. Alphabet Inc. • Integration the acquired company\' accounting, human resource, and other administrative systems, and coordination product, engineering, and sales and marketing functions. • Transition operations, users, and customers onto our existing platforms. • Failure obtain required approvals timely basis, all, from governmental authorities, conditions placed upon approval that could, among other things, delay prevent from completing transaction, otherwise restrict our ability realize the expected financial strategic goals acquisition other strategic transaction. • the case foreign acquisitions, the need integrate operations across different cultures and languages and address the particular economic, currency, political, and regulatory risks associated with specific countries. • Cultural challenges associated with integrating employees from the acquired company into our organization, and retention employees from the businesses acquire. • Liability for activities the acquired company before the acquisition, including patent and trademark infringement claims, privacy issues, violations laws, commercial disputes, tax liabilities, and other known and unknown liabilities. • Litigation other claims connection with the acquired company, including claims from terminated employees, customers, former stockholders, other third parties.

These manufacturing and supply chain risks could affect our ability supply both our products and our internet-based services. rely third parties manufacture many our assemblies and finished products, third-party arrangements for the design some components and parts, and third party distributors, including cellular network carriers. Our business could negatively affected are not able engage third parties with the necessary capabilities capacity reasonable terms, those engage fail meet their obligations (whether due financial difficulties other reasons), make adverse changes the pricing other material terms our arrangements with them. Alphabet Inc. may experience supply shortages and price increases driven raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, natural disasters, the effects climate change (such sea level rise, drought, flooding, wildfires, and increased storm severity), and significant changes the financial business condition our suppliers. may experience shortages other supply chain disruptions the future that could negatively affect our operations. addition, some the components use our technical infrastructure and products are available only from single source limited sources, and may not able find replacement vendors favorable terms all the event supply chain disruption. addition, significant hardware supply interruption could delay critical data center upgrades expansions. may enter into long term contracts that commit significant terms and conditions supply. may liable for material and product that not consumed due market acceptance, technological change, obsolescences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because many our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing minimum purchase requirements, the volume our hardware sales decreases does not reach projected targets, could face increased materials and manufacturing costs other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively affect our financial results. Furthermore, certain our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may affect our supply. The products and services sell offer may have quality issues resulting from the design manufacture the product, from the software used. Sometimes, these issues may caused components purchase from other manufacturers suppliers. the quality our products and services does not meet our users’ and customers’ expectations our products services are found defective, then our sales and operating earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could negatively affected. also require our suppliers and business partners comply with law and, where applicable, our company policies, such the Google Supplier Code Conduct, regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but not control them their practices. any them violates laws implements practices regarded unethical, could experience supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations damage key relationships, and damage our reputation. any them fails procure necessary license rights third-party intellectual property, legal action could ensue that could affect the saleability our products and expose financial obligations third parties. Web spam, including content farms, and other violations our guidelines could affect the quality our services, which could damage our reputation and deter our current and potential users from using our products and services. Web spam refers websites that violate attempt violate our guidelines that otherwise seek inappropriately rank higher search results than our search engine\' assessment their relevance and utility would rank them. Web spam may also affect the quality content posted our platforms and may manipulate them display false, misleading undesirable content. Although English-language web spam our search results has been significantly reduced, and web spam most other languages limited, expect web spammers will continue seek ways improve their rankings inappropriately. continuously combat web spam our search results, including through indexing technology that makes harder for spam-like, less useful web content rank highly. also continue invest and deploy proprietary technology detect and prevent web spam from abusing our platforms. also face other challenges from web spam such low-quality and irrelevant content websites, including content farms, which are websites that generate large quantities low-quality content help them improve their search rankings. are continually launching algorithmic changes focused low-quality websites. , like others the industry, face other violations our guidelines, including sophisticated attempts bad actors manipulate our advertising systems fraudulently generate revenues for themselves others, otherwise generate traffic that does not represent genuine user interest intent. While invest significantly efforts detect and prevent invalid traffic, including attempts bad actors generate income fraudulently, may unable adequately detect and prevent such abuses the future. are subject increasing number web spam, including content farms other violations our guidelines, this could hurt our reputation for delivering relevant information reduce user traffic our websites their use our platforms, which may adversely affect our financial condition results.

Some our data centers are located areas with high risk major earthquakes other natural disasters. Our data centers are also subject break-ins, sabotage, and intentional acts vandalism, and potential disruptions the operators certain these facilities have financial difficulties. Some our systems are not fully redundant, and our disaster recovery planning cannot account for all eventualities. The occurrence natural disaster, decision close facility are using, other unanticipated problems our data centers could result lengthy interruptions our service. addition, our products and services are highly technical and complex and may contain errors vulnerabilities, which could result interruptions our services the failure our systems. Our international operations expose additional risks that could harm our business, operating results, and financial condition. Our international operations are significant our revenues and net income, and plan continue grow internationally. International revenues accounted for approximately % our consolidated revenues . addition risks described elsewhere this section, our international operations expose other risks, including the following: • Restrictions foreign ownership and investments, and stringent foreign exchange controls that might prevent from repatriating cash earned countries outside the . • Import and export requirements, tariffs, trade disputes and barriers, and customs classifications that may prevent from offering products providing services particular market and may increase our operating costs. • Longer payment cycles some countries, increased credit risk, and higher levels payment fraud. • Evolving foreign laws and legal systems, including those that may occur result the United Kingdom\' potential withdrawal from the European Union ("Brexit"). Brexit may adversely affect global economic and market conditions and could contribute volatility the foreign exchange markets, which may unable effectively manage through our foreign exchange risk management program. Brexit may also adversely affect our revenues and could subject new regulatory costs and challenges, addition other adverse effects that are unable effectively anticipate. • Uncertainty regarding liability for services and content, including uncertainty result local laws and lack legal precedent. • Different employee employer relationships, existence workers\' councils and labor unions, and other challenges caused distance, language, and cultural differences, making harder business certain jurisdictions. Changes international local political, economic, regulatory, tax, social, and labor conditions may also harm our business, and compliance with complex international and . laws and regulations that apply our international operations increases our cost doing business. These numerous and sometimes conflicting laws and regulations include, among others, internal control and disclosure rules, privacy and data protection requirements, anti-corruption laws, such the . Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, and other local laws prohibiting certain payments governmental officials, and competition regulations, among others. Violations these laws and regulations could result fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against , our officers, our employees, prohibitions the conduct our business and our ability offer our products and services one more countries, and could also materially affect our brand, our international growth efforts, our ability attract and retain employees, our business, and our operating results. Although have implemented policies and procedures designed ensure compliance with these laws and regulations, there can assurance that our employees, contractors, agents will not violate our policies. Since conduct business currencies other than . dollars but report our financial results . dollars, face exposure fluctuations foreign currency exchange rates.

The loss key personnel could seriously harm our business. rely highly skilled personnel and, are unable retain motivate key personnel, hire qualified personnel, maintain our corporate culture, may not able grow effectively. Our performance largely depends the talents and efforts highly skilled individuals. Our future success depends our continuing ability identify, hire, develop, motivate, and retain highly skilled personnel for all areas our organization. Competition our industry for qualified employees intense, and certain our competitors have directly targeted our employees. addition, our compensation arrangements, such our equity award programs, may not always successful attracting new employees and retaining and motivating our existing employees. Our continued ability compete effectively depends our ability attract new employees and retain and motivate our existing employees. addition, believe that our corporate culture fosters innovation, creativity, and teamwork. our organization grows, and are required implement more complex organizational management structures, particularly light our holding company structure, may find increasingly difficult maintain the beneficial aspects our corporate culture. This could negatively affect our future success. Our business depends continued and unimpeded access the Internet and our users. Internet access providers may able restrict, block, degrade, charge for access certain our products and services, which could lead additional expenses and the loss users and advertisers. Our products and services depend the ability our users access the Internet, and certain our products require significant bandwidth work effectively. Currently, this access provided companies that have significant market power the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some these providers have taken, have stated that they may take measures, including legal actions, that could degrade, disrupt, increase the cost user access certain our products restricting prohibiting the use their infrastructure support facilitate our offerings, charging increased fees our users provide our offerings. Some jurisdictions have adopted regulations prohibiting certain forms discrimination Internet access providers; however, substantial uncertainty exists the United States and elsewhere regarding such protections. For example, the United States the Federal Communications Commission repealed net neutrality rules effective June , , which could lead internet access providers restrict, block, degrade, charge for access certain our products and services. addition, some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject government-initiated restrictions blockages. Such interference could result loss existing users, customers and advertisers, goodwill, and increased costs, and could impair our ability attract new users, customers and advertisers, thereby harming our revenues and growth. New and existing technologies could affect our ability customize ads and could block ads online, which would harm our business. Technologies have been developed make customizable ads more difficult block the display ads altogether and some providers online services have integrated technologies that could potentially impair the core functionality third-party digital advertising. Most our Google revenues are derived from fees paid connection with the display ads online. result, such technologies and tools could adversely affect our operating results. are exposed fluctuations the market values our investments. Given the global nature our business, have investments both domestically and internationally. Market values these investments can negatively affected liquidity, credit deterioration losses, financial results, foreign exchange rates, changes interest rates, including changes that may result from the implementation new benchmark rates that replace LIBOR, the effect new changing regulations, other factors.

Alphabet Inc. result these factors, the value liquidity our cash equivalents, well our marketable and non-marketable securities could decline and result material impairment, which could materially adversely affect our financial condition and operating results. could subject changes tax rates, the adoption new . international tax legislation, exposure additional tax liabilities. Our future income taxes could adversely affected earnings being lower than anticipated jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, the net gains and losses recognized legal entities certain hedges and related hedged intercompany and other transactions under our foreign exchange risk management program, changes the valuation our deferred tax assets liabilities, changes tax laws, regulations, accounting principles, well certain discrete items. addition, are subject regular review and audit both domestic and foreign tax authorities. result, have received, and may the future receive, assessments multiple jurisdictions various tax-related assertions, examples include transfer pricing adjustments permanent establishment. Any adverse outcome such review audit could have negative effect our operating results and financial condition. addition, the determination our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment, and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination uncertain. Although believe our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results the period periods for which such determination made. Furthermore, due shifting economic and political conditions, tax policies, laws rates various jurisdictions may subject significant change, which could materially affect our financial position and results operations.

Should any Alphabet Inc. our estimates and assumptions change prove have been incorrect, could have material effect our business, consolidated financial position, results operations, cash flows. Long-lived Assets Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, long-term prepayments, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events changes circumstances indicate that the carrying amount asset may not recoverable. The evaluation performed the lowest level identifiable cash flows independent other assets. impairment loss would recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement impairment loss would based the excess the carrying amount the asset group over its fair value. Valuation Non-marketable Equity Securities Beginning January , , our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are carried either fair value under the measurement alternative upon the adoption ASU - . Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value measured cost, less any impairment, plus minus changes resulting from observable price changes orderly transactions for the identical similar investment the same issuer. Determining whether observed transaction similar security within our portfolio requires judgment based the rights and obligations the securities. Recording upward and downward adjustments the carrying value our equity securities result observable price changes requires quantitative assessments the fair value our securities using various valuation methodologies and involves the use estimates. Non-marketable equity securities are also subject periodic impairment reviews. Our quarterly impairment analysis considers both qualitative and quantitative factors that may have significant effect the investment' fair value. Qualitative factors considered include industry and market conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other relevant events and factors. When indicators impairment exist, prepare quantitative assessments the fair value our equity investments using both the market and income approaches which require judgment and the use estimates, including discount rates, investee revenues and costs, and comparable market data private and public companies, among others. When our assessment indicates that impairment exists, measure our non-marketable securities fair value. ", 'item 7a. ': 'QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK are exposed financial market risks, including changes foreign currency exchange rates, interest rates, and equity investment risks. Foreign Currency Exchange Risk transact business globally multiple currencies. Our international revenues, well costs and expenses denominated foreign currencies, expose the risk fluctuations foreign currency exchange rates against the . dollar. Principal currencies hedged included the Australian dollar, British pound, Canadian dollar, Euro and Japanese yen. For the purpose analyzing foreign currency exchange risk, considered the historical trends foreign currency exchange rates and determined that was reasonably possible that adverse changes exchange rates % could experienced the near term. use foreign exchange forward contracts offset the foreign exchange risk our assets and liabilities denominated currencies other than the local currency the subsidiary. These forward contracts reduce, but not entirely eliminate, the effect foreign currency exchange rate movements our assets and liabilities. The foreign currency gains and losses the assets and liabilities are recorded other income (expense), net, which are offset the gains and losses the forward contracts. adverse % foreign currency exchange rate change was applied total monetary assets and liabilities denominated currencies other than the local currencies the balance sheet dates, would have resulted adverse effect income before income taxes approximately $ million and $ million December , and , respectively. The adverse effect December , and after consideration the offsetting effect approximately $ million for both periods from foreign exchange contracts place for the months ended December , and December , . use foreign currency forwards and option contracts, including collars ( option strategy comprised combination purchased and written options) protect our forecasted . dollar-equivalent earnings from changes foreign currency exchange rates. When the . dollar strengthens, gains from foreign currency options and forwards reduce the foreign currency losses related our earnings. When the . dollar weakens, losses from foreign currency collars and forwards offset the foreign currency gains related our earnings. These hedging contracts reduce, but Alphabet Inc. not entirely eliminate, the effect foreign currency exchange rate movements. designate these contracts cash flow hedges for accounting purposes. reflect the gains losses foreign currency spot rate changes component AOCI and subsequently reclassify them into revenues offset the hedged exposures they occur. the . dollar weakened % December , and December , , the amount recorded AOCI related our foreign exchange contracts before tax effect would have been approximately $ million and $ million lower December , and December , , respectively. The change the value recorded AOCI would expected offset corresponding foreign currency change forecasted hedged revenues when recognized. During , entered into foreign exchange forward contracts designated net investment hedges hedge the foreign currency risks related our investment foreign subsidiaries. These forward contracts serve offset the foreign currency translation risk from our foreign operations. the . dollar weakened %, the amount recorded cumulative translation adjustment (CTA) within AOCI related our net investment hedge would have been approximately $ million lower December , . The change value recorded CTA would expected offset corresponding foreign currency translation gain loss from our investment foreign subsidiaries. Interest Rate Risk Our investment strategy achieve return that will allow preserve capital and maintain liquidity requirements. invest primarily debt securities including those the . government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued foreign governments. policy, limit the amount credit exposure any one issuer. Our investments both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning securities carry degree interest rate risk. Fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely affected due rise interest rates, while floating rate securities may produce less income than predicted interest rates fall. Unrealized gains losses our marketable debt securities are primarily due interest rate fluctuations result higher market interest rates compared interest rates the time purchase. account for both fixed and variable rate securities fair value with gains and losses recorded AOCI until the securities are sold. use value- -risk (VaR) analysis determine the potential effect fluctuations interest rates the value our marketable debt security portfolio.

VaR analysis not intended represent actual losses but used risk estimation. Equity Investment Risk Our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are subject wide variety market‑related risks that could substantially reduce increase the fair value our holdings. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks funds and our non-marketable equity securities are investments privately held companies, some which are the startup development stages. record our marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method fair value based readily determinable market values, which publicly traded stocks and mutual funds are subject market price volatility, and represent $ billion our investments December , . hypothetical adverse price change %, which could experienced the near term, would decrease the fair value our marketable equity securities $ million . Our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are adjusted fair value for observable transactions for identical similar investments the same issuer impairment (referred the Alphabet Inc. measurement alternative). The fair value measured the time the observable transaction, which not necessarily indication the current fair value the balance sheet date. These investments, especially those that are the early stages, are inherently risky because the technologies products these companies have under development are typically the early phases and may never materialize and they may experience decline financial condition, which could result loss substantial part our investment these companies. The success our investment any private company also typically dependent the likelihood our ability realize value our investments through liquidity events such public offerings, acquisitions, private sales other favorable market events reflecting appreciation the cost our initial investment. December , , the carrying value our non-marketable equity securities, which were accounted for under the measurement alternative, was $ billion . Valuations our equity investments private companies are inherently more complex due the lack readily available market data. Volatility the global economic climate and financial markets could result significant impairment charge our non-marketable equity securities.

Noncontrolling interests are not presented separately the amounts are not material. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated. Use Estimates Preparation consolidated financial statements conformity with generally accepted accounting principles the United States (GAAP) requires make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. ongoing basis, evaluate our estimates, including those related the bad debt allowance, sales allowances, fair values financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives intangible assets and property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. base our estimates assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed reasonable, the results which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values assets and liabilities. Revenue Recognition recognize revenues when transfer control promised goods services our customers amount that reflects the consideration which expect entitled exchange for those goods services. See Note for further discussion Revenues. Cost Revenues Cost revenues consists TAC and other costs revenues. TAC represents the amounts paid Google Network Members primarily for ads displayed their properties and amounts paid our distribution partners who make available our search access points and services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment manufacturers, and software developers. Other costs revenues (which the cost revenues excluding TAC) include the following: • Content acquisition costs primarily related payments content providers from whom license video and other content for distribution YouTube and Google Play ( pay fees these content providers based revenues generated flat fee); • Expenses associated with our data centers and other operations (including bandwidth, compensation expense (including SBC), depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs); and • Inventory related costs for hardware sell. Stock-based Compensation Stock-based compensation primarily consists Alphabet restricted stock units (RSUs). RSUs are equity classified and measured the fair market value the underlying stock the grant date. recognize RSU expense using the straight-line attribution method over the requisite service period and account for forfeitures they occur. For RSUs, shares are issued the vesting dates net the applicable statutory tax withholding paid behalf our employees. result, fewer shares are issued than the number RSUs outstanding. record liability for the tax withholding paid reduction additional paid- capital. Additionally, stock-based compensation includes other types stock-based awards that may settled the stock certain our Other Bets cash. Awards that are liability classified are remeasured fair value through settlement maturity. The fair value such awards based the valuation equity the respective Other Bet. Alphabet Inc. Performance Fees have compensation arrangements with payouts based realized investment returns. recognize compensation expense based the estimated payouts. Certain Risks and Concentrations Our revenues are primarily derived from online advertising, the market for which highly competitive and rapidly changing. addition, our revenues are generated from multitude vertical market segments countries around the world. Significant changes this industry changes customer buying advertiser spending behavior could adversely affect our operating results. are subject concentrations credit risk principally from cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign exchange contracts, and accounts receivable. Cash equivalents and marketable securities consist primarily time deposits, money market and other funds, highly liquid debt instruments the . government and its agencies, debt instruments issued foreign governments, debt instruments issued municipalities the ., corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed securities, and asset-backed securities. Foreign exchange contracts are transacted with various financial institutions with high credit standing.

See Note for further details. Fair Value Financial Instruments Our financial assets and liabilities that are measured fair value recurring basis include cash equivalents, marketable securities, derivative contracts, and non-marketable debt securities. Our financial assets that are measured fair value nonrecurring basis include non-marketable equity securities measured fair value when observable price changes are identified when non-marketable equity securities are impaired . Other financial assets and liabilities are carried cost with fair value disclosed, required. Fair value exit price, representing the amount that would received sell asset paid transfer liability orderly transaction between market participants. such, fair value market-based measurement that determined based assumptions that market participants would use pricing asset liability. Assets and liabilities recorded fair value are measured and classified accordance with three-tier fair value hierarchy based the observability the inputs available the market used measure fair value: Level - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets liabilities active markets. Level - Inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments active markets, quoted prices for identical similar instruments markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable the market can derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings. Level - Unobservable inputs that are supported little market activities. The fair value hierarchy requires entity maximize the use observable inputs and minimize the use unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities invest all excess cash primarily government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgage-backed and asset-backed securities, time deposits, and money market funds. classify all investments that are readily convertible known amounts cash and have stated maturities three months less from the date purchase cash equivalents and those with stated maturities greater than three months marketable securities. determine the appropriate classification our investments marketable securities the time purchase and reevaluate such designation each balance sheet date. have classified and accounted for our marketable debt securities available-for-sale. After consideration our risk versus reward objectives, well our liquidity requirements, may sell these debt securities prior their stated maturities. view these securities available Alphabet Inc. support current operations, classify highly liquid securities with maturities beyond months current assets under the caption marketable securities the Consolidated Balance Sheets. carry these securities fair value, and report the unrealized gains and losses, net taxes, component stockholders’ equity, except for unrealized losses determined other-than-temporary, which record within other income (expense), net. determine any realized gains losses the sale marketable debt securities specific identification method, and record such gains and losses component other income (expense), net. Non-Marketable Investments account for non-marketable equity investments through which exercise significant influence but not have control over the investee under the equity method. Beginning January , , our non-marketable equity securities not accounted for under the equity method are either carried fair value under the measurement alternative upon the adoption ASU - . Under the measurement alternative, the carrying value measured cost, less any impairment, plus minus changes resulting from observable price changes orderly transactions for identical similar investments the same issuer. Adjustments are determined primarily based market approach the transaction date. classify our non-marketable investments non-current assets the Consolidated Balance Sheets those investments not have stated contractual maturity dates. account for our non-marketable investments that meet the definition debt security available-for-sale securities. Impairment Investments periodically review our debt and equity investments for impairment. For debt securities consider the duration, severity and the reason for the decline security value; whether more likely than not that will required sell the security before recovery its amortized cost basis; the amortized cost basis cannot recovered result credit losses. any impairment considered other-than-temporary, will write down the security its fair value and record the corresponding charge other income (expense), net. For equity securities consider impairment indicators such negative changes industry and market conditions, financial performance, business prospects, and other relevant events and factors. indicators exist and the fair value the security below the carrying amount, write down the security fair value. Variable Interest Entities determine the inception each arrangement whether entity which have made investment which have other variable interests considered variable interest entity (VIE). consolidate VIEs when are the primary beneficiary. The primary beneficiary VIE the party that meets both the following criteria: ( ) has the power make decisions that most significantly affect the economic performance the VIE; and ( ) has the obligation absorb losses the right receive benefits that either case could potentially significant the VIE. Periodically, assess whether any changes our interest relationship with the entity affect our determination whether the entity still VIE and, , whether are the primary beneficiary. are not the primary beneficiary VIE, account for the investment other variable interests VIE accordance with applicable GAAP. Accounts Receivable record accounts receivable the invoiced amount. maintain allowance for doubtful accounts reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. review the accounts receivable amounts due from customers that are past due identify specific customers with known disputes collectability issues. determining the amount the reserve, make judgments about the creditworthiness significant customers based ongoing credit evaluations. Property and Equipment Property and equipment includes the following categories: land and buildings, information technology assets, construction progress, leasehold improvements, and furniture and fixtures. Land and buildings include land, offices, data centers and related building improvements. Information technology assets include servers and network equipment. account for property and equipment cost less accumulated depreciation. compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives the assets. depreciate buildings over periods seven years. generally depreciate information technology assets over periods three five years (specifically, three years for servers and three five years for network equipment). depreciate leasehold improvements over the shorter the remaining lease term the estimated useful lives the assets. Construction progress the construction development property and equipment that have not yet been placed service for our intended use. Depreciation for equipment, buildings, and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use. Land not depreciated. Alphabet Inc. Inventory Inventory consists primarily finished goods and stated the lower cost and net realizable value. Cost computed using the first- , first-out method. Software Development Costs expense software development costs, including costs develop software products the software component products sold, leased, marketed external users, before technological feasibility reached. Technological feasibility typically reached shortly before the release such products and result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented. Software development costs also include costs develop software used solely meet internal needs and cloud based applications used deliver our services. capitalize development costs related these software applications once the preliminary project stage complete and probable that the project will completed and the software will used perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented. Business Combinations include the results operations the businesses that acquire the acquisition date. allocate the purchase price the acquisitions the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based their estimated fair values. The excess the purchase price over the fair values identifiable assets and liabilities recorded goodwill. Acquisition-related expenses are recognized separately from the business combination and are expensed incurred. Long-Lived Assets, Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets review property and equipment, long-term prepayments and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, for impairment when events changes circumstances indicate the carrying amount may not recoverable. measure recoverability these assets comparing the carrying amounts the future undiscounted cash flows that the assets the asset group are expected generate. the carrying value the assets are not recoverable, the impairment recognized measured the amount which the carrying value the asset exceeds its fair value. Impairments were not material for the periods presented. allocate goodwill reporting units based the expected benefit from the business combination. evaluate our reporting units when changes our operating structure occur, and necessary, reassign goodwill using relative fair value allocation approach. test our goodwill for impairment least annually, more frequently events changes circumstances indicate that the asset may impaired. Goodwill impairments were not material for the periods presented. Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives. amortize intangible assets straight-line basis with definite lives over periods ranging from one twelve years. Income Taxes account for income taxes using the asset and liability method, under which recognize the amount taxes payable refundable for the current year and deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences events that have been recognized our financial statements tax returns. measure current and deferred tax assets and liabilities based provisions enacted tax law. evaluate the realization our deferred tax assets based all available evidence and establish valuation allowance reduce deferred tax assets when more likely than not that they will not realized. recognize the financial statement effects tax position when more likely than not that, based technical merits, the position will sustained upon examination. The tax benefits the position recognized the financial statements are then measured based the largest amount benefit that greater than % likely realized upon settlement with taxing authority. addition, recognize interest and penalties related unrecognized tax benefits component the income tax provision. Foreign Currency Generally, the functional currency our international subsidiaries the local currency. translate the financial statements these subsidiaries . dollars using month-end exchange rates for assets and liabilities, and average rates for the annual period derived from month-end exchange rates for revenues, costs, and expenses. record translation gains and losses accumulated other comprehensive income (AOCI) component stockholders’ equity. reflect net foreign exchange transaction gains and losses resulting from the conversion the transaction currency functional currency component foreign currency exchange losses other income (expense), net.
