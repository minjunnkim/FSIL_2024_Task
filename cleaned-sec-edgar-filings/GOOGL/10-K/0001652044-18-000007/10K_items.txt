Some companies have longer operating histories and more established relationships with customers and users. They can use their experiences and resources ways that could affect our competitive position, including making acquisitions, continuing invest heavily research and development and hiring talent, aggressively initiating intellectual property claims (whether not meritorious), and continuing compete aggressively for users, advertisers, and content providers. Emerging start-ups may able innovate and provide products and services faster than can may foresee the consumer need for products and services before . addition, new products and services can sometimes present new and difficult technological and legal challenges, which may negatively impact our brands and demand for our products and services and adversely impact our revenues and operating results. Our operating results would also suffer our innovations are not responsive the needs our users, advertisers, and content providers; are not appropriately timed with market opportunities; are not effectively brought market. technologies continue develop, our competitors may able offer user experiences that are, that are seen , substantially similar better than ours.

Adverse macroeconomic conditions can also have material negative impact user activity and the demand for advertising and cause our advertisers reduce the amounts they spend advertising, which could adversely affect our revenues and advertising business. Alphabet Inc. Our ongoing investment new businesses and new products, services, and technologies inherently risky, and could disrupt our current operations. have invested and expect continue invest new businesses, products, services, and technologies. The creation Alphabet holding company and the investments that are making across various areas Google and Other Bets are reflection our ongoing efforts innovate and provide products and services that are useful users. Such endeavors may involve significant risks and uncertainties, including insufficient revenues from such investments offset any new liabilities assumed and expenses associated with these new investments, inadequate return capital our investments, distraction management from current operations, use alternative investment compensation structures, and unidentified issues not discovered our due diligence such strategies and offerings that could cause fail realize the anticipated benefits such investments and incur unanticipated liabilities. Because these new ventures are inherently risky, assurance can given that such strategies and offerings will successful and will not adversely affect our reputation, financial condition, and operating results. The Internet accessed through variety platforms and form factors that continue evolve with the advancement technology and user preferences. manufacturers and users not widely adopt versions our search technology, products, operating systems developed for these devices and modalities, our business could adversely affected. The number people who access the Internet through devices other than desktop computers, including mobile phones, smartphones, laptops and tablets, video game consoles, voice-assisted speakers, automobiles, and television set-top devices, increasing dramatically. The functionality and user experience associated with some alternative devices and modalities may make the use our products and services the generation advertising revenue through such devices more difficult ( just different), and the versions our products and services developed for these devices may not compatible compelling users, manufacturers, distributors alternative devices. Each manufacturer distributor may establish unique technical standards for its devices, and our products and services may not work viewable these devices result. Some manufacturers may also elect not include our products their devices. addition, search queries are increasingly being undertaken via apps tailored particular devices social media platforms, which could affect our search and advertising business over time. new devices and platforms are continually being released, difficult predict the problems may encounter adapting our products and services and developing competitive new products and services. expect continue devote significant resources the creation, support, and maintenance products and services across multiple platforms and devices. are unable attract and retain substantial number alternative device manufacturers, suppliers, distributors, developers, and users our products and services, are slow develop products and technologies that are more compatible with alternative devices and platforms, will fail capture the opportunities available consumers and advertisers continue exist dynamic, multi-platform environment. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time, and anticipate downward pressure our operating margin the future. Our revenue growth rate could decline over time result number factors, including: • increasing competition, • changes device mix, geographic mix, ongoing product and policy changes, product mix, and property mix, • the challenges maintaining our growth rate our revenues increase higher levels, • the evolution the online advertising market, including the increasing variety online platforms for advertising, and the other markets which participate, and • the rate user adoption our products, services, and technologies. believe our margins could experience downward pressure result increasing competition and increased costs for many aspects our business well the continuing shift mobile, changes device mix, and the contribution new businesses overall revenue. For instance, the margin revenues generate from our Google Network Members significantly less than the margin revenues generate from advertising Google properties. Consequently, our margins will experience downward pressure greater percentage our revenues comes from ads placed our Google Network Members' properties compared revenues generated through ads placed Google properties. Additionally, the margin earn revenues generated from our Google Network Members could decrease the future pay even larger percentage advertising fees our Google Network Members. Furthermore, our multi-device world, generate our advertising revenues increasingly from mobile and newer advertising formats, and the margins from the advertising revenues from these sources have generally been lower than those from traditional desktop search. also expect our TAC paid our distribution partners increase due changes device mix between mobile, desktop, and tablet, partner mix, partner agreement terms, and the percentage queries channeled through paid access points.

Additionally, changes public policies governing wide range topics may adversely affect our business. The growth our company and our expansion into variety new fields involves variety new regulatory issues, and have experienced increased regulatory scrutiny have grown. For instance, various regulatory agencies are reviewing aspects our search and other businesses, which can lead increased scrutiny from other regulators and legislators, that may affect our reputation, brand and third-party relationships. Such reviews may also result substantial regulatory fines, changes our business practices and other penalties, which could negatively impact our business and results operations. continue cooperate with the European Commission and other regulatory authorities around the world investigations they are conducting with respect our business.

Furthermore, many these laws not contemplate address the unique issues raised number our new businesses, products, services and technologies. addition, the applicability and scope these laws, interpreted the courts, remain uncertain. Other laws that could subject claims otherwise harm our business include, among others: • rely statutory safe harbors, set forth the Digital Millennium Copyright Act the United States and the -Commerce Directive Europe, against copyright liability for various linking, caching, and hosting activities.

Additionally, cyber attacks could also compromise trade secrets and other sensitive information and result such information being disclosed others and becoming less valuable, which could negatively affect our business. actual perceived breach our security occurs, the market perception the effectiveness our security measures could harmed and could lose users and customers. Our business subject complex and evolving . and international laws and regulation regarding privacy and data protection.

Recent legal developments Europe have created compliance uncertainty regarding certain transfers personal data from Europe the United States. For example, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), coming into application the European Union ( ) May , , will apply all our activities conducted from establishment the related products and services that offer users. The GDPR will create range new compliance obligations, which could cause change our business practices, and will significantly increase financial penalties for noncompliance (including possible fines % global annual turnover for the preceding financial year € million (whichever higher) for the most serious infringements). addition, the European Commission July and the Swiss Government January approved the - . and the Swiss- .

However, these frameworks face number legal challenges and their validity remains subject legal, regulatory and political developments both Europe and the . This has resulted some uncertainty, and compliance obligations could cause incur costs require change our business practices manner adverse our business. Alphabet Inc. are, and may the future , subject intellectual property other claims, which are costly defend, could result significant damage awards, and could limit our ability use certain technologies the future. Internet, technology, media, and other companies own large numbers patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets and frequently enter into litigation based allegations infringement other violations intellectual property rights. addition, patent holding companies may continue seek monetize patents they have purchased otherwise obtained. have grown, the number intellectual property claims against has increased and may continue increase develop new products, services, and technologies. have had patent, copyright, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against claiming that certain our products, services, and technologies infringe the intellectual property rights others. Third parties have also sought broad injunctive relief against filing claims . and international courts and the . International Trade Commission (ITC) for exclusion and cease and desist orders, which could limit our ability sell our products services the . elsewhere our products services those our customers suppliers are found infringe the intellectual property subject the claims. Adverse results any these lawsuits may include awards substantial monetary damages, costly royalty licensing agreements ( licenses are available all), orders preventing from offering certain features, functionalities, products, services, and may also cause change our business practices and require development non-infringing products, services technologies, which could result loss revenues for and otherwise harm our business. Many our agreements with our customers and partners, including certain suppliers, require indemnify them for certain intellectual property infringement claims against them, which could increase our costs result defending such claims, and may require that pay significant damages there were adverse ruling any such claims. Such customers and partners may also discontinue the use our products, services, and technologies, result injunctions otherwise, which could result loss revenues and adversely impact our business. Moreover, intellectual property indemnities provided our suppliers, when obtainable, may not cover all damages and losses suffered and our customers from covered products. Furthermore, connection with our divestitures, have agreed, and may the future agree, provide indemnification for certain potential liabilities, including those associated with intellectual property claims. Regardless their merits, intellectual property claims are often time consuming, expensive litigate settle, and cause significant diversion management attention. the extent such claims are successful, they may have adverse effect our business, consolidated financial position, results operations, cash flows. Our intellectual property rights are valuable, and any inability protect them could reduce the value our products, services, and brand. Our patents, trademarks, trade secrets, copyrights, and other intellectual property rights are important assets for . Various events outside our control pose threat our intellectual property rights, well our products, services and technologies. For example, effective intellectual property protection may not available every country which our products and services are distributed made available through the Internet. Also, the efforts have taken protect our proprietary rights may not sufficient effective. Although seek obtain patent protection for our innovations, possible may not able protect some these innovations. Moreover, may not have adequate patent copyright protection for certain innovations that later turn out important. Furthermore, there always the possibility, despite our efforts, that the scope the protection gained will insufficient that issued patent may deemed invalid unenforceable. also seek maintain certain intellectual property trade secrets. The secrecy such trade secrets and other sensitive information could compromised outside parties, our employees, which could cause lose the competitive advantage resulting from these trade secrets. also face risks associated with our trademarks. For example, there risk that the word “Google” could become commonly used that becomes synonymous with the word “search.” this happens, could lose protection for this trademark, which could result other people using the word “Google” refer their own products, thus diminishing our brand. Any significant impairment our intellectual property rights could harm our business and our ability compete. Also, protecting our intellectual property rights costly and time consuming. Any increase the unauthorized use our intellectual property could make more expensive business and harm our operating results. Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments, and divestitures could result operating difficulties, dilution, and other consequences that may adversely impact our business and results operations. Acquisitions, joint ventures, investments and divestitures are important elements our overall corporate strategy and use capital, and these transactions could material our financial condition and results operations. Alphabet Inc. expect continue evaluate and enter into discussions regarding wide array potential strategic transactions.

Alphabet Inc. face number manufacturing and supply chain risks that, not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results and prospects. face number risks related manufacturing and supply chain management. These manufacturing and supply chain risks could impact our ability supply both our products and our internet-based services. rely third parties manufacture many our assemblies and finished products, third-party arrangements for the design some components and parts, and third party distributors, including cellular network carriers. Our business could negatively affected are not able engage third parties with the necessary capabilities capacity reasonable terms, those engage fail meet their obligations (whether due financial difficulties other reasons), make adverse changes the pricing other material terms our arrangements with them. have the past, and may experience the future, supply shortages and price increases driven raw material availability, manufacturing capacity, labor shortages, industry allocations, natural disasters and significant changes the financial business condition our suppliers. may experience shortages other supply chain disruptions the future that could negatively impact our operations. addition, some the components use our technical infrastructure and products are available only from single source limited sources, and may not able find replacement vendors favorable terms all the event supply chain disruption. addition, significant hardware supply interruption could delay critical data center upgrades expansions. may enter into long term contracts that commit significant terms and conditions supply. may liable for material and product that not consumed due market acceptance, technological change, obsolescences, quality, product recalls, and warranty issues. For instance, because many our hardware supply contracts have volume-based pricing minimum purchase requirements, the volume our hardware sales decreases does not reach projected targets, could face increased materials and manufacturing costs other financial liabilities that could make our products more costly per unit manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively impact our financial results. Furthermore, certain our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may impact our supply. Additionally, the products and services sell offer may have quality issues resulting from the design manufacture the product, from the software used. Sometimes, these issues may caused components purchase from other manufacturers suppliers. the quality our products and services does not meet our customers’ expectations our products services are found defective, then our sales and operating earnings, and ultimately our reputation, could negatively impacted. also require our suppliers and business partners comply with law and, where applicable, our company policies regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but not control them their practices. any them violates laws implements practices regarded unethical, could experience supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations damage key relationships, and damage our reputation. any them fails procure necessary license rights third-party intellectual property, legal action could ensue that could impact the saleability our products and expose financial obligations third parties. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes disclosure requirements regarding the use certain minerals mined from the Democratic Republic Congo and adjoining countries (DRC) and procedures pertaining manufacturer' efforts regarding the source such minerals. SEC rules implementing these requirements may have the effect reducing the pool suppliers who can supply DRC conflict free components and parts, and may not able obtain DRC conflict free products supplies sufficient quantities for our operations. Since our supply chain complex, may face reputational challenges with our customers, stockholders and other stakeholders are unable sufficiently verify the origins for the minerals used our products.

Accounting for the income tax effects the Tax Act requires significant judgments and estimates the interpretation and calculations the provisions the Tax Act. Due the timing the enactment and the complexity involved applying the provisions the Tax Act, have made reasonable estimates the effects and recorded provisional amounts our financial statements for the year ended December , . collect and prepare necessary data, and interpret any additional guidance issued the . Treasury Department, the IRS other standard-setting bodies, may make adjustments the provisional amounts. Those adjustments may materially impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate the period which the adjustments are made. The accounting for the tax effects the enactment the Tax Act will completed . Although believe have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, assurance can given that the final tax outcome these matters will not different. adjust these reserves light changing facts and circumstances, such the closing tax audit the refinement estimate. the extent that the final tax outcome these matters different than the amounts recorded, such differences will impact the provision for income taxes and the effective tax rate the period which such determination made. The provision for income taxes includes the impact reserve provisions and changes reserves that are considered appropriate well the related net interest and penalties. addition, are subject the continuous examination our income tax returns the IRS and other tax authorities which may assert assessments against . regularly assess the likelihood adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations and assessments determine the adequacy our provision for income taxes. Loss Contingencies are regularly subject claims, suits, government investigations, and other proceedings involving competition and antitrust, intellectual property, privacy, non-income taxes, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated our users, goods and services offered advertisers publishers using our platforms, and other matters. Certain these matters include speculative claims for substantial indeterminate amounts damages. record liability when believe that probable that loss has been incurred and the amount can reasonably estimated. determine that loss reasonably possible and the loss range loss can estimated, disclose the possible loss the Notes the Consolidated Financial Statements. evaluate, regular basis, developments our legal matters that could affect the amount liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments and changes our disclosures appropriate. Significant judgment required determine both the likelihood there being, and the estimated amount , loss related such matters. Until the final resolution such matters, there may exposure loss excess the amount recorded, and such amounts could material. Should any our estimates and assumptions change prove have been incorrect, could have material impact our business, consolidated financial position, results operations, cash flows. See Note Notes Consolidated Financial Statements included Item this Annual Report Form - for additional information regarding contingencies. Business Combinations allocate the fair value purchase consideration the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based their estimated fair values. The excess the fair value purchase consideration over the fair values these identifiable assets and liabilities recorded goodwill. When determining the fair values Alphabet Inc. assets acquired and liabilities assumed, management makes significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect intangible assets. Critical estimates valuing certain intangible assets include but are not limited future expected cash flows (primarily from customer relationships and acquired patents and developed technology) and discount rates. Management’ estimates fair value are based upon assumptions believed reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, result, actual results may differ from estimates. Other estimates associated with the accounting for acquisitions may change additional information becomes available regarding the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, more fully discussed Note Notes Consolidated Financial Statements included Item this Annual Report Form - . Goodwill Goodwill allocated reporting units expected benefit from the business combination. evaluate our reporting units when changes our operating structure occur, and necessary, reassign goodwill using relative fair value allocation approach. test goodwill for impairment the reporting unit level least annually, more frequently events changes circumstances indicate that the asset may impaired. Goodwill impairment tests require judgment, including the identification reporting units, assignment assets and liabilities reporting units, assignment goodwill reporting units, and determination the fair value each reporting unit. Long-lived Assets Long-lived assets, including property and equipment, long-term prepayments, and intangible assets, excluding goodwill, are reviewed for impairment whenever events changes circumstances indicate that the carrying amount asset may not recoverable. The evaluation performed the lowest level identifiable cash flows independent other assets. impairment loss would recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows generated from the assets are less than their carrying amount. Measurement impairment loss would based the excess the carrying amount the asset group over its fair value. Impairment Securities periodically review our securities for impairment. conclude that any these investments are impaired, determine whether such impairment other-than-temporary. Factors consider make such determination include the duration and severity the impairment, the reason for the decline value and the potential recovery period and our intent sell. For marketable debt securities, also consider whether ( ) more likely than not that will required sell the security before recovery its amortized cost basis, and ( ) the amortized cost basis cannot recovered result credit losses. any impairment considered other-than-temporary, will write down the asset its fair value and record the corresponding charge other income (expense), net.

Assets and liabilities recorded fair value are measured and classified accordance with three-tier fair value hierarchy based the observability the inputs available the market used measure fair value: Level - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets liabilities active markets. Level - Include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments active markets, quoted prices for identical similar instruments markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable the market can derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings. Level - Unobservable inputs that are supported little market activities.

Inventory Inventory consists primarily finished goods and stated the lower cost and net realizable value. Cost computed using the first- , first-out method. Software Development Costs expense software development costs, including costs develop software products the software component products sold, leased, marketed external users, before technological feasibility reached. Technological feasibility typically reached shortly before the release such products and result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented. Software development costs also include costs develop software used solely meet internal needs and cloud based applications used deliver our services. capitalize development costs related these software applications once the preliminary project stage complete and probable that the project will completed and the software will used perform the function intended. Costs capitalized for developing such software applications were not material for the periods presented. Business Combinations include the results operations the businesses that acquire the acquisition date. allocate the purchase price our acquisitions the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based their estimated fair values.

Advertising Revenues generate revenues primarily delivering advertising Google properties and Google Network Members’ properties. Google properties revenues consist primarily advertising revenues generated Google com, the Google Search app, and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, Google Play, and YouTube. Google Network Members’ properties revenues consist primarily advertising revenues generated Google Network Members’ properties. Our customers generally purchase advertising inventory through AdWords, DoubleClick AdExchange, and DoubleClick Bid Manager, among others. Most our customers pay cost-per-click basis (CPC), which means that advertiser pays only when user clicks Google properties Google Network Members\' properties views certain YouTube engagement ads. For these customers, recognize revenue each time user clicks the when user views the for specified period time. also offer advertising other bases such cost-per-impression (CPM), which means advertiser pays based the number times their ads are displayed Google properties Google Network Members’ properties. For these customers, recognize revenue each time displayed. Certain customers may receive cash-based incentives credits, which are accounted for variable consideration. estimate these amounts based the expected amount provided customers and reduce revenues recognized. believe that there will not significant changes our estimates variable consideration. For ads placed Google Network Members’ properties, evaluate whether are the principal ( ., report revenues gross basis) agent ( ., report revenues net basis). Generally, report advertising revenues for ads placed Google Network Members’ properties gross basis, that , the amounts billed our customers are recorded revenues, and amounts paid Google Network Members are recorded cost revenues. Where are the principal, control the advertising inventory before transferred our customers. Our control evidenced our sole ability monetize the advertising inventory before transferred our customers, and further supported being primarily responsible our customers and having level discretion establishing pricing. Other Revenues Google other revenues and Other Bets revenues consist primarily revenues from: • Apps, -app purchases, and digital content the Google Play store; • Google Cloud offerings; • Hardware; and • Other miscellaneous products and services. relates Google other revenues, the most significant judgment determining whether are the principal agent for app sales and -app purchases through the Google Play store. report revenues from these transactions net basis because our performance obligation facilitate transaction between app developers and end users, Alphabet Inc. for which earn commission. Consequently, the portion the gross amount billed end users that remitted app developers not reflected revenues. Arrangements with Multiple Performance Obligations Our contracts with customers may include multiple performance obligations. For such arrangements, allocate revenues each performance obligation based its relative standalone selling price. generally determine standalone selling prices based the prices charged customers using expected cost plus margin. Deferred Revenues record deferred revenues when cash payments are received due advance our performance, including amounts which are refundable. The increase the deferred revenue balance for the twelve months ended December , primarily driven cash payments received due advance satisfying our performance obligations, offset $ million revenues recognized that were included the deferred revenue balance December , . Our payment terms vary the type and location our customer and the products services offered. The term between invoicing and when payment due not significant. For certain products services and customer types, require payment before the products services are delivered the customer. Practical Expedients and Exemptions generally expense sales commissions when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year less. These costs are recorded within sales and marketing expenses. not disclose the value unsatisfied performance obligations for ( ) contracts with original expected length one year less and ( ) contracts for which recognize revenue the amount which have the right invoice for services performed.
