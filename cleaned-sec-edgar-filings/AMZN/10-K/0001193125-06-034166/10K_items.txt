The majority our NOLs begin expire . Additionally, have elected present our NOL deferred tax assets attributed stock-based compensation net the related allowance the adoption SFAS ( ). Total gross deferred tax assets related our NOLs December , were $ million (relating approximately $ billion NOLs). SFAS , Accounting for Income Taxes, requires that deferred tax assets evaluated for future realization and reduced valuation allowance the extent believe portion will not realized. consider many factors when assessing the likelihood future realization our deferred tax assets including our recent cumulative earnings experience taxing jurisdiction, expectations future taxable income, the carry-forward periods available for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. accordance with the provisions SFAS , allocate our valuation allowance current and long-term deferred tax assets pro-rata basis. recorded tax benefit $ million, representing $ and $ basic and diluted earnings per share, determined year end that certain our deferred tax assets were more likely than not realizable. The range possible judgments relating valuation our deferred tax assets very wide. For example, had determined that the weight available evidence did not support decision that these deferred tax assets are realizable; the \x93Provision (benefit) for income taxes\x94 would have been expense $ million for rather than expense $ million for the same period. December , continue have valuation allowance $ million, which relates primarily deferred tax assets that would only realizable upon the occurrence future capital gains. Stock-Based Compensation January , , early adopted SFAS ( ), which requires measure compensation cost for stock awards fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected vest. The estimation stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and the extent actual results updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will recorded cumulative adjustment the period estimates are revised. consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results, and future changes estimates, may differ substantially from our current estimates. Liquidity and Capital Resources Our financial focus long-term, sustainable growth free cash flow . Free cash flow was $ million for , which includes the effect $ million patent litigation settlement, compared $ million and $ million for and . Operating cash flows and free cash flows can volatile and are sensitive many factors, including changes working capital and timing capital expenditures. Working capital any specific point time subject many variables, including seasonality, the timing expense payments, discounts offered vendors, vendor payment terms, and fluctuations foreign exchange rates. Our principal sources liquidity are cash flows generated from operations and our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities balances, which, fair value, were $ billion and $ billion the end and . Amounts held foreign currencies were $ million and $ million the end and , and were primarily Euros, British Pounds, and Yen. Prior the adoption SFAS ( ), cash retained result tax deductions relating stock-based compensation was presented operating cash flows, along with other tax cash flows. SFAS ( ) supersedes prior guidance and requires tax benefits relating excess stock-based compensation deductions prospectively presented the statement cash flows financing cash inflows, which effectively reclassification between operating cash flows and financing cash flows versus prior presentation. Tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation deductions excess amounts reported for financial reporting purposes were $ million, $ million, and $ million for December , , , and , with the amount for treated financing cash flows the detriment operating cash flow. expect the corresponding amount for increase substantially and possibly excess $ million, although the actual amount Free cash flow defined net cash provided operating activities less purchases fixed assets, including capitalized internal-use software and website development, both which are presented our consolidated statements cash flows. subject considerable variability. Accordingly, amounts presented for operating cash flows and free cash flows for will negatively effected comparison prior results; however, the underlying economic substance not effected this change reporting classification. Cash provided operating activities was $ million, $ million, and $ million , , and . Our operating cash flows result primarily from cash received from our customers, from third-party sellers, and from non-retail activities such through our -branded credit card agreements, Amazon Enterprise Solutions, and miscellaneous marketing and promotional agreements, offset cash payments make for products and services, employee compensation (less amounts capitalized pursuant SOP - that are reflected cash used investing activities), payment processing and related transaction costs, operating leases, and interest payments our long-term debt obligations. Cash received from customers, third-party sellers and non-retail activities generally corresponds our net sales. Because our customers primarily use credit cards buy from , our receivables from customers settle quickly. Cash paid inventory and transportation suppliers generally corresponds with cost sales, adjusted for increases decreases inventory and payable levels well increases decreases vendor-related receivables for -operative marketing, volume rebates, and other incentives. During , cash paid inventory suppliers, totaled $ billion, compared $ billion and $ billion and .

Such value recognized expense over the service period, net estimated forfeitures, using the accelerated method under SFAS ( ). The estimation stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and the extent actual results updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will recorded cumulative adjustment the period estimates are revised. consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results, and future changes estimates, may differ substantially from our current estimates. For example, the fourth quarter recorded benefit $ million, $ million net tax, $ per diluted share, representing the cumulative effect slightly increasing the rate forfeitures expected over the life issued stock awards based our historical experience. Additionally, because implemented SFAS ( ), longer have employee stock awards subject variable accounting treatment. The adoption SFAS ( ) resulted cumulative benefit from accounting change $ million , which reflects the net cumulative impact estimating future forfeitures the determination period expense, rather than recording forfeitures when they occur previously permitted.

Tax benefits resulting from stock-based compensation deductions excess amounts reported for financial reporting purposes were $ million, $ million, and $ million for December , , , and , with the amount for treated financing cash flows the detriment operating cash flow. expect the corresponding amount for increase substantially and possibly excess $ million, although the actual amount subject considerable variability. Accordingly, amounts presented for operating cash flows and free cash flows for will negatively effected comparison prior results; however, the underlying economic substance not effected this change reporting classification. March , , the SEC published Staff Accounting Bulletin (SAB) . , which provides the Staff\x92 views variety matters relating stock-based payments.
