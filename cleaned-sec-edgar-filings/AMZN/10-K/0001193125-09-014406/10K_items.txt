Revenue Recognition recognize revenue from product sales services rendered when the following four revenue recognition criteria are met: persuasive evidence arrangement exists, delivery has occurred services have been rendered, the selling price fixed determinable, and collectability reasonably assured. Additionally, revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables are divided into separate units accounting the deliverables the arrangement meet the following criteria: the delivered item has value the customer standalone basis; there objective and reliable evidence the fair value undelivered items; and delivery any undelivered item probable. evaluate the criteria Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF) Issue . - , Reporting Revenue Gross Principal Versus Net Agent , determining whether appropriate record the gross amount product sales and related costs the net amount earned commissions.

Product sales and shipping revenues, net promotional discounts, rebates, and return allowances, are recorded when the products are shipped and title passes customers. Retail items sold customers are made pursuant sales contracts that generally provide for transfer both title and risk loss upon our delivery the carrier. Return allowances, which reduce product revenue our best estimate expected product returns, are estimated using historical experience. Revenue from product sales and services rendered recorded net sales taxes. Amounts paid advance for subscription services, including amounts received for Amazon Prime and other membership programs, are deferred and recognized revenue over the subscription term. For our products with multiple elements, where standalone value for each element cannot established, recognize the revenue and related cost over the estimated economic life the product. periodically provide incentive offers our customers encourage purchases. Such offers include current discount offers, such percentage discounts off current purchases, inducement offers, such offers for future discounts subject minimum current purchase, and other similar offers. Current discount offers, when accepted our customers, are treated reduction the purchase price the related transaction, while inducement offers, when accepted our customers, are treated reduction purchase price based estimated future redemption rates.

Goodwill evaluate goodwill for impairment annually and when event occurs circumstances change suggest that the carrying value may not recoverable. Our annual testing date October . test goodwill for impairment first comparing the book value net assets the fair value the related operations. the fair value determined less than book value, second step performed compute the amount impairment. estimate fair value using discounted cash flows reporting units. Forecasts future cash flow are based our best estimate future net sales and operating expenses, based primarily projected category expansion, pricing expectations, market segment penetration and general economic conditions. Additionally, certain estimates discounted cash flows involve businesses and geographies with limited financial history and developing revenue models. this process, fair value for goodwill estimated and compared its carrying value. The shortfall the fair value below carrying value represents the amount goodwill impairment. Changes these forecasts could significantly change the amount impairment recorded, any. The financial and credit market volatility directly impacts our fair value measurement through our weighted average cost capital that use determine our discount rate and through our stock price that use determine our market capitalization. During times volatility, significant judgment must applied determine whether credit stock price changes are short term swing longer-term trend.

Stock-Based Compensation measure compensation cost for stock awards fair value and recognize compensation over the service period for awards expected vest. The fair value restricted stock and restricted stock units determined based the number shares granted and the quoted price our common stock. The estimation stock awards that will ultimately vest requires judgment, and the extent actual results updated estimates differ from our current estimates, such amounts will recorded cumulative adjustment the period estimates are revised. consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures, including types awards, employee class, and historical experience. Actual results and future estimates may differ substantially from our current estimates. utilize the accelerated method, rather than straight-line method, for recognizing compensation expense. Under this method, over % the compensation cost would expensed the first year four year vesting term. The accelerated method also adds higher level sensitivity and complexity estimating forfeitures. forfeited early the life award, the forfeited amount much greater under accelerated method than under straight-line method. Income Taxes are subject income taxes both the . and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment required evaluating our tax positions and determining our provision for income taxes. During the ordinary course business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination uncertain. establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based estimates whether, and the extent which, additional taxes will due. These reserves for tax contingencies are established when believe that certain positions might challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable. adjust these reserves light changing facts and circumstances, such the outcome tax audit. The provision for income taxes includes the impact reserve provisions and changes reserves that are considered appropriate.
