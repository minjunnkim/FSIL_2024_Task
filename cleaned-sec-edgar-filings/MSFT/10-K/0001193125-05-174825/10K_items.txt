Our largest MSTV competitors include IBM, Cisco, UTStarcom, and Siemens Myrio. PAGE Part Item RISK FACTORS Challenges our business model may reduce our revenues and operating margins. Our business model based upon customers agreeing pay fee license software developed and distributed . Under this commercial software model, software developers bear the costs converting original ideas into software products through investments research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from the distribution their products. believe the commercial software model has had substantial benefits for users software, allowing them rely our expertise and the expertise other software developers that have powerful incentives develop innovative software that useful, reliable, and compatible with other software and hardware. recent years, non-commercial software model has evolved that presents growing challenge the commercial software model. Under the non-commercial software model, open source software produced loosely associated groups unpaid programmers and made available for license end users without charge distributed firms nominal cost that earn revenue complementary services and products, without having bear the full costs research and development for the open source software. The most notable example open source software the Linux operating system. There wide variety other open source software available, such Open Office org and Eclipse. While believe our products provide customers with significant advantages security and productivity, and generally have lower total cost ownership than open source software, the popularization the non-commercial software model continues pose significant challenge our business model, including recent efforts proponents open source software convince governments worldwide mandate the use open source software their purchase and deployment software products. the extent open source software gains increasing market acceptance, sales our products may decline, may have reduce the prices charge for our products, and revenue and operating margins may consequently decline. face intense competition. continue experience intense competition across all markets for our products and services. Our competitors range size from Fortune companies small, single-product businesses that are highly specialized and open source community-based projects. While believe the breadth our businesses and product portfolio offers benefits our customers that are competitive advantage, our competitors that are focused narrower product line may more effective devoting technical, marketing, and financial resources compete with . addition, barriers entry our businesses generally are low. The Internet distribution channel and non-commercial software model described above have reduced barriers entry even further. Non-commercial software vendors are devoting considerable efforts developing software that mimics the features and functionality various our products. response competitive factors, are developing versions our products with basic functionality that are sold lower prices than the standard versions. See Part , Item this report for additional information about our competitors. These competitive pressures may result decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and increased operating costs, such for marketing and sales incentives, resulting lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. may not able protect our intellectual property rights against piracy, infringement our patents third parties, declining legal protection for intellectual property. defend our intellectual property rights and combat unlicensed copying and use software and intellectual property rights through variety techniques. Preventing unauthorized use infringement our rights difficult. Piracy our products represents loss revenue . While this adversely affects . revenue, the impact revenue from outside the United States more significant, particularly countries where laws are less protective intellectual property rights. Similarly, the absence harmonized patent laws makes more difficult ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Moreover, future legal changes could make this even more challenging. Throughout the world, actively educate consumers about the benefits licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and educate lawmakers about the advantages business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. However, continued educational and enforcement efforts may not affect revenue positively, and revenue could adversely affected reductions the legal protection for intellectual property rights for software developers compliance with additional legal obligations impacting the intellectual property rights software developers. Third parties may claim infringe their intellectual property rights. From time time receive notices from others claiming infringe their intellectual property rights. The number these claims may grow.

While license certain portions our source code for various software programs and operating systems number licensees, take significant measures protect the secrecy large portions our source code. unauthorized disclosure significant portion our source code occurs, could potentially lose future trade secret protection for that source code. The loss future trade secret protection could make easier for third parties compete with our products copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure source code could also increase certain risks described the next paragraph. Security vulnerabilities our products could lead reduced revenues liability claims. Maintaining the security computers and computer networks issue critical importance for and our customers. There are malicious hackers who develop and deploy viruses, worms, and other malicious software programs that attack our products. While this industry-wide phenomenon that affects computers across all platforms, affects our products particular because hackers tend focus their efforts the most popular operating systems and programs and expect them continue . devote significant resources addressing these critical issues. are focusing our efforts engineering even more secure products, enhancing security and reliability options and settings when deliver products, and providing guidance help our customers make the best use our products and services protect against computer viruses and other attacks their computing environment. addition, are working improve the deployment software updates address security vulnerabilities discovered after our products are released. are also investing mitigation technologies that help secure customers from attacks even when such software updates are not deployed. are also advising customers how help protect themselves from security threats through the use our online automated security tools, our published security guidance, and the deployment security software such firewalls, antivirus, and other security software. The cost these steps could adversely affect our operating margins. Despite these efforts, actual perceived security vulnerabilities our products could lead some customers seek return products, reduce delay future purchases, use competitive products. Customers may also increase their expenditures protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption new technologies. Any these actions customers could adversely affect our revenue. devote significant resources improving the security design and engineering our software. Nevertheless, actual perceived vulnerabilities may lead claims against . While our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate limit our exposure such liability claims, there assurance these provisions will held effective under applicable laws and judicial decisions. are subject government regulatory activity that affects how design and market our products.

Moreover, there always remains the risk new legal action, either governments private claimants including with respect products that haven\x92 been scrutinized the past.

The availability these alternative versions Windows the market also may cause confusion that harms our reputation, including among consumers and with third party software and web site developers who rely the functionality removed from these alternative versions. The Commission ruling obligates Microsoft make available specifications for certain Windows communications protocol technologies licensing terms that are closely regulated the Commission.

APPLICATION CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared accordance with . GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected management\x92 application accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for include revenue recognition, impairment investment securities, impairment goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation. account for the licensing software accordance with American Institute Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement Position (SOP) - , Software Revenue Recognition. The application SOP - requires judgment, including whether software arrangement includes multiple elements, and , whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) fair value exists for those elements. Customers receive certain elements our products over period time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right receive unspecified upgrades enhancements Microsoft Internet Explorer when-and- -available basis, the fair value which recognized over the product\x92 estimated life cycle. Changes the elements software arrangement, the PAGE Part Item ability identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value the respective elements, and changes product\x92 estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount earned and unearned revenue. Judgment also required assess whether future releases certain software represent new products upgrades and enhancements existing products. SFAS . , Accounting for Certain Investments Debt and Equity Securities , and SEC SAB , Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities , provide guidance determining when investment other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. making this judgment, employ systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence evaluating potential impairment our investments. the cost investment exceeds its fair value, evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent which the fair value less than cost, and our intent and ability hold the investment. also consider specific adverse conditions related the financial health and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once decline fair value determined other-than-temporary, impairment charge recorded and new cost basis the investment established. market, industry and investee conditions deteriorate, may incur future impairments. SFAS . , Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , requires that goodwill tested for impairment the reporting unit level (operating segment one level below operating segment) annual basis (July for ) and between annual tests event occurs circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value reporting unit below its carrying value. These events circumstances could include significant change the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale disposition significant portion reporting unit. Application the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification reporting units, assignment assets and liabilities reporting units, assignment goodwill reporting units, and determination the fair value each reporting unit. The fair value each reporting unit estimated using discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation future cash flows, which dependent internal forecasts, estimation the long-term rate growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination our weighted average cost capital. Changes these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. account for research and development costs accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS . , Accounting for Research and Development Costs , and SFAS . , Accounting for the Costs Computer Software Sold, Leased, Otherwise Marketed . SFAS . specifies that costs incurred internally researching and developing computer software product should charged expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility established, all software costs should capitalized until the product available for general release customers. Judgment required determining when technological feasibility product established. have determined that technological feasibility for our software products reached shortly before the products are released manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility established are not material, and accordingly, expense all research and development costs when incurred. The outcomes legal proceedings and claims brought against are subject significant uncertainty. SFAS . , Accounting for Contingencies, requires that estimated loss from loss contingency such legal proceeding claim should accrued charge income probable that asset has been impaired liability has been incurred and the amount the loss can reasonably estimated. Disclosure contingency required there least reasonable possibility that loss has been incurred. determining whether loss should accrued evaluate, among other factors, the degree probability unfavorable outcome and the ability make reasonable estimate the amount loss. Changes these factors could materially impact our financial position our results operations. SFAS . , Accounting for Income Taxes , establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect income taxes. The objectives accounting for income taxes are recognize the amount taxes payable refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences events that have been recognized entity\x92 financial statements tax returns. Judgment required assessing the future tax consequences events that have been recognized our financial statements tax returns. Variations the actual outcome these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results operations, cash flows. PAGE Part Item , account for stock-based compensation accordance with the fair value recognition provisions SFAS . , Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions SFAS . , stock-based compensation cost measured the grant date based the value the award and recognized expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value stock-based awards the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term stock options, the expected volatility our stock and expected dividends. addition, judgment also required estimating the amount stock-based awards that are expected forfeited. actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results operations could materially impacted. ITEM . QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK are exposed foreign currency, interest rate, fixed income, equity and commodity price risks. portion these risks hedged, but fluctuations could impact our results operations and financial position. hedge portion anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure foreign currency fluctuations, primarily with option contracts. monitor our foreign currency exposures daily maximize the overall effectiveness our foreign currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Fixed income securities are subject interest rate risk. The portfolio diversified and structured minimize credit risk. Securities held our equity and other investments portfolio are subject price risk, and are generally not hedged. However, use options hedge our price risk certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes. use value- -risk (VAR) model estimate and quantify our market risks. VAR the expected loss, for given confidence level, fair value our portfolio due adverse market movements over defined time horizon. The VAR model not intended represent actual losses fair value, but used risk estimation and management tool. The model used for currencies and equities geometric Brownian motion, which allows incorporation optionality with regard these risk exposures. For interest rate risk, the mean reverting geometric Brownian motion used reflect the principle that fixed-income securities prices revert maturity value over time. VAR calculated , first, simulating , market price paths over specified period time for equities, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, taking into account historical correlations among the different rates and prices. Each resulting unique set equities prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates then applied substantially all individual holdings -price each holding. The 250th worst performance (out , ) represents the VAR over specified period time the percentile confidence level. Several risk factors are not captured the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, credit risk, and legal risk. Certain securities our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes. hedge the value portion these securities through the use derivative contracts such put-call collars. these arrangements, hedge security\x92 equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most all the benefits the security\x92 appreciation above the sold call strike, exchange for the premium received for the sold call. also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes. have incurred material impairment charges related these securities previous periods. The VAR amounts disclosed below are used risk management tool and reflect estimate potential reductions fair value our portfolio. Losses fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported VAR significant amounts and can also accumulate over longer time horizon than the specified holding period used the VAR analysis. VAR amounts are not necessarily reflective potential accounting losses, including determinations other-than-temporary losses fair value accordance with . GAAP. The VAR numbers are shown separately for interest rate, currency, equity and commodity risks. These VAR numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges. use historical data estimate VAR. Given the reliance historical data, VAR most effective estimating risk exposures markets which there are fundamental changes shifts market conditions. inherent limitation VAR that the distribution past changes market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions future market risk. PAGE Part Item Management began using -day VAR for internal risk measurement purposes effective for the quarter-ended March , .

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Preparing financial statements requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples include estimates loss contingencies and product life cycles, and assumptions such the elements comprising software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility achieved for our products; the potential outcome future tax consequences events that have been recognized our financial statements tax returns; estimating the fair value and goodwill impairment for our reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management\x92 estimates and assumptions. FOREIGN CURRENCIES Assets and liabilities recorded foreign currencies are translated the exchange rate the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated average rates exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged credited Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue recognized when persuasive evidence arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee fixed determinable, and collectibility probable. enter into certain arrangements where are obligated deliver multiple products and services (multiple elements). these arrangements, generally allocate the total revenue among the elements based the sales price each element when sold separately (vendor-specific objective evidence).

The amount revenue allocated undelivered elements based the vendor-specific objective evidence fair value for those elements using the residual method. Under the residual method, the total fair value the undelivered elements, indicated vendor-specific objective evidence, recorded unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount recorded unearned for the undelivered elements recognized revenue related delivered elements. Unearned revenue due undelivered elements recognized ratably straight-line basis over the related product\x92 life cycle.

APPLICATION CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared accordance with . GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected management\x92 application accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for include revenue recognition, impairment investment securities, impairment goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation. account for the licensing software accordance with American Institute Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement Position (SOP) - , Software Revenue Recognition.

These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right receive unspecified upgrades enhancements Microsoft Internet Explorer when-and- -available basis, the fair value which recognized over the product\x92 estimated life cycle. Changes the elements software arrangement, the PAGE Part Item ability identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value the respective elements, and changes product\x92 estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount earned and unearned revenue. Judgment also required assess whether future releases certain software represent new products upgrades and enhancements existing products. SFAS . , Accounting for Certain Investments Debt and Equity Securities , and SEC SAB , Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities , provide guidance determining when investment other-than-temporarily impaired.

This determination requires significant judgment. making this judgment, employ systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence evaluating potential impairment our investments. the cost investment exceeds its fair value, evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent which the fair value less than cost, and our intent and ability hold the investment. also consider specific adverse conditions related the financial health and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once decline fair value determined other-than-temporary, impairment charge recorded and new cost basis the investment established. market, industry and investee conditions deteriorate, may incur future impairments. SFAS . , Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , requires that goodwill tested for impairment the reporting unit level (operating segment one level below operating segment) annual basis (July for ) and between annual tests event occurs circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value reporting unit below its carrying value. These events circumstances could include significant change the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale disposition significant portion reporting unit.

The fair value each reporting unit estimated using discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation future cash flows, which dependent internal forecasts, estimation the long-term rate growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination our weighted average cost capital. Changes these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. account for research and development costs accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS . , Accounting for Research and Development Costs , and SFAS . , Accounting for the Costs Computer Software Sold, Leased, Otherwise Marketed . SFAS . specifies that costs incurred internally researching and developing computer software product should charged expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility established, all software costs should capitalized until the product available for general release customers. Judgment required determining when technological feasibility product established. have determined that technological feasibility for our software products reached shortly before the products are released manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility established are not material, and accordingly, expense all research and development costs when incurred. The outcomes legal proceedings and claims brought against are subject significant uncertainty. SFAS . , Accounting for Contingencies, requires that estimated loss from loss contingency such legal proceeding claim should accrued charge income probable that asset has been impaired liability has been incurred and the amount the loss can reasonably estimated. Disclosure contingency required there least reasonable possibility that loss has been incurred. determining whether loss should accrued evaluate, among other factors, the degree probability unfavorable outcome and the ability make reasonable estimate the amount loss. Changes these factors could materially impact our financial position our results operations.

Net gains investments also include other-than-temporary impairments $ million fiscal year compared $ million fiscal year . Investments are considered impaired when decline fair value judged other than temporary. employ systematic methodology that considers available evidence evaluating potential impairment our investments. the cost investment exceeds its fair value, evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent which the fair value less than cost, and our intent and ability hold the investment. also consider specific adverse conditions related the financial health and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once decline fair value determined other than temporary, impairment charge recorded and new cost basis the investment established. Derivative instruments are used manage exposures interest rates, equity prices, and foreign currency exchange rates and facilitate portfolio diversification. Net derivative losses fiscal year were primarily related losses equity derivatives, interest rate derivatives, and foreign currency contracts.

APPLICATION CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared accordance with . GAAP. Preparing financial statements requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected management\x92 application accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for include revenue recognition, impairment investment securities, impairment goodwill, accounting for research and development costs, accounting for legal contingencies, accounting for income taxes, and accounting for stock-based compensation. account for the licensing software accordance with American Institute Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement Position (SOP) - , Software Revenue Recognition. The application SOP - requires judgment, including whether software arrangement includes multiple elements, and , whether vendor-specific objective evidence (VSOE) fair value exists for those elements. Customers receive certain elements our products over period time. These elements include free post-delivery telephone support and the right receive unspecified upgrades enhancements Microsoft Internet Explorer when-and- -available basis, the fair value which recognized over the product\x92 estimated life cycle. Changes the elements software arrangement, the PAGE Part Item ability identify VSOE for those elements, the fair value the respective elements, and changes product\x92 estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount earned and unearned revenue. Judgment also required assess whether future releases certain software represent new products upgrades and enhancements existing products. SFAS . , Accounting for Certain Investments Debt and Equity Securities , and SEC SAB , Accounting for Noncurrent Marketable Equity Securities , provide guidance determining when investment other-than-temporarily impaired. Investments are reviewed quarterly for indicators other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. making this judgment, employ systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence evaluating potential impairment our investments. the cost investment exceeds its fair value, evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, the duration and extent which the fair value less than cost, and our intent and ability hold the investment. also consider specific adverse conditions related the financial health and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes technology, operational and financing cash flow factors, and rating agency actions. Once decline fair value determined other-than-temporary, impairment charge recorded and new cost basis the investment established. market, industry and investee conditions deteriorate, may incur future impairments. SFAS . , Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets , requires that goodwill tested for impairment the reporting unit level (operating segment one level below operating segment) annual basis (July for ) and between annual tests event occurs circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value reporting unit below its carrying value. These events circumstances could include significant change the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale disposition significant portion reporting unit. Application the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification reporting units, assignment assets and liabilities reporting units, assignment goodwill reporting units, and determination the fair value each reporting unit. The fair value each reporting unit estimated using discounted cash flow methodology. This requires significant judgments including estimation future cash flows, which dependent internal forecasts, estimation the long-term rate growth for our business, the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination our weighted average cost capital. Changes these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. account for research and development costs accordance with several accounting pronouncements, including SFAS . , Accounting for Research and Development Costs , and SFAS . , Accounting for the Costs Computer Software Sold, Leased, Otherwise Marketed . SFAS . specifies that costs incurred internally researching and developing computer software product should charged expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility established, all software costs should capitalized until the product available for general release customers. Judgment required determining when technological feasibility product established. have determined that technological feasibility for our software products reached shortly before the products are released manufacturing. Costs incurred after technological feasibility established are not material, and accordingly, expense all research and development costs when incurred. The outcomes legal proceedings and claims brought against are subject significant uncertainty. SFAS . , Accounting for Contingencies, requires that estimated loss from loss contingency such legal proceeding claim should accrued charge income probable that asset has been impaired liability has been incurred and the amount the loss can reasonably estimated. Disclosure contingency required there least reasonable possibility that loss has been incurred. determining whether loss should accrued evaluate, among other factors, the degree probability unfavorable outcome and the ability make reasonable estimate the amount loss. Changes these factors could materially impact our financial position our results operations. SFAS . , Accounting for Income Taxes , establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect income taxes. The objectives accounting for income taxes are recognize the amount taxes payable refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences events that have been recognized entity\x92 financial statements tax returns. Judgment required assessing the future tax consequences events that have been recognized our financial statements tax returns. Variations the actual outcome these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position, results operations, cash flows. PAGE Part Item , account for stock-based compensation accordance with the fair value recognition provisions SFAS . , Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation. Under the fair value recognition provisions SFAS . , stock-based compensation cost measured the grant date based the value the award and recognized expense over the vesting period. Determining the fair value stock-based awards the grant date requires judgment, including estimating the expected term stock options, the expected volatility our stock and expected dividends. addition, judgment also required estimating the amount stock-based awards that are expected forfeited. actual results differ significantly from these estimates, stock-based compensation expense and our results operations could materially impacted. ITEM . QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK are exposed foreign currency, interest rate, fixed income, equity and commodity price risks. portion these risks hedged, but fluctuations could impact our results operations and financial position. hedge portion anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure foreign currency fluctuations, primarily with option contracts. monitor our foreign currency exposures daily maximize the overall effectiveness our foreign currency hedge positions. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. Fixed income securities are subject interest rate risk. The portfolio diversified and structured minimize credit risk. Securities held our equity and other investments portfolio are subject price risk, and are generally not hedged. However, use options hedge our price risk certain equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes. use value- -risk (VAR) model estimate and quantify our market risks. VAR the expected loss, for given confidence level, fair value our portfolio due adverse market movements over defined time horizon. The VAR model not intended represent actual losses fair value, but used risk estimation and management tool. The model used for currencies and equities geometric Brownian motion, which allows incorporation optionality with regard these risk exposures. For interest rate risk, the mean reverting geometric Brownian motion used reflect the principle that fixed-income securities prices revert maturity value over time. VAR calculated , first, simulating , market price paths over specified period time for equities, interest rates and foreign exchange rates, taking into account historical correlations among the different rates and prices. Each resulting unique set equities prices, interest rates, and foreign exchange rates then applied substantially all individual holdings -price each holding. The 250th worst performance (out , ) represents the VAR over specified period time the percentile confidence level. Several risk factors are not captured the model, including liquidity risk, operational risk, credit risk, and legal risk. Certain securities our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes. hedge the value portion these securities through the use derivative contracts such put-call collars. these arrangements, hedge security\x92 equity price risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most all the benefits the security\x92 appreciation above the sold call strike, exchange for the premium received for the sold call. also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes. have incurred material impairment charges related these securities previous periods. The VAR amounts disclosed below are used risk management tool and reflect estimate potential reductions fair value our portfolio. Losses fair value over the specified holding period can exceed the reported VAR significant amounts and can also accumulate over longer time horizon than the specified holding period used the VAR analysis. VAR amounts are not necessarily reflective potential accounting losses, including determinations other-than-temporary losses fair value accordance with . GAAP. The VAR numbers are shown separately for interest rate, currency, equity and commodity risks. These VAR numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges. use historical data estimate VAR. Given the reliance historical data, VAR most effective estimating risk exposures markets which there are fundamental changes shifts market conditions. inherent limitation VAR that the distribution past changes market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions future market risk.

Equity investments which exercise significant influence but not control and are not the primary beneficiary are accounted for using the equity method. Investments which are not able exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the cost method. ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS Preparing financial statements requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples include estimates loss contingencies and product life cycles, and assumptions such the elements comprising software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility achieved for our products; the potential outcome future tax consequences events that have been recognized our financial statements tax returns; estimating the fair value and goodwill impairment for our reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management\x92 estimates and assumptions. FOREIGN CURRENCIES Assets and liabilities recorded foreign currencies are translated the exchange rate the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated average rates exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are charged credited Other Comprehensive Income (OCI). REVENUE RECOGNITION Revenue recognized when persuasive evidence arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee fixed determinable, and collectibility probable. enter into certain arrangements where are obligated deliver multiple products and services (multiple elements). these arrangements, generally allocate the total revenue among the elements based the sales price each element when sold separately (vendor-specific objective evidence). Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), and perpetual licenses for current products under our Open and Select volume licensing programs generally recognized products are shipped, with portion the revenue recorded unearned due undelivered elements including, some cases, free post-delivery telephone support and the right receive unspecified upgrades enhancements Microsoft Internet Explorer when-and- -available basis. The amount revenue allocated undelivered elements based the vendor-specific objective evidence fair value for those elements using the residual method. Under the residual method, the total fair value the undelivered elements, indicated vendor-specific objective evidence, recorded unearned, and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount recorded unearned for the undelivered elements recognized revenue related delivered elements. Unearned revenue due undelivered elements recognized ratably straight-line basis over the related product\x92 life cycle. Revenue from multi-year licensing arrangements are accounted for subscriptions, with billings recorded unearned revenue and recognized revenue ratably over the billing coverage period. Certain multi-year licensing arrangements include rights receive future versions software product when-and- -available basis under Open and Select volume licensing programs (currently named Software Assurance and, previously named Upgrade Advantage). addition, other multi-year licensing arrangements include perpetual license for current products combined with rights receive future versions software products when-and- -available basis under Open, Select, and Enterprise Agreement volume licensing programs.

Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact these exposures effectively possible. Derivative instruments are recognized either assets liabilities and are measured fair value. The accounting for changes the fair value derivative depends the intended use the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instrument designated fair-value hedge, the gain loss recognized earnings the period change together with the offsetting loss gain the hedged item attributed the risk being hedged. For derivative instrument designated cash-flow hedge, the effective portion the derivative\x92 gain loss initially reported component OCI and subsequently recognized earnings when the hedged exposure affects earnings. The ineffective portion the gain loss recognized earnings. For options designated either fair-value cash-flow hedges, changes the time value are excluded from the assessment hedge effectiveness and are recognized earnings. Gains and losses from changes fair values derivatives that are not designated hedges for accounting purposes are recognized earnings. Foreign Currency Risk.
