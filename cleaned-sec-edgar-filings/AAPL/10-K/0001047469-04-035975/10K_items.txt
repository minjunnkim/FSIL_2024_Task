Although the Company believes has taken certain steps strengthen its position the education market, there can assurance that the Company will able increase maintain its share the education market execute profitably large strategic arrangements. Failure may have adverse impact the Company\' operating results and financial condition. The Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions order remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand. Due the highly volatile and competitive nature the personal computer and consumer electronics industries, which are characterized dynamic customer demand patterns and rapid technological advances, the Company must continually introduce new products and technologies, enhance existing products order remain competitive, and effectively stimulate customer demand for new products and upgraded versions the Company\' existing products. The success new product introductions dependent number factors, including market acceptance; the Company\' ability manage the risks associated with product transitions, including production ramp issues; the availability application software for new products; the effective management inventory levels line with anticipated product demand; the availability products appropriate quantities meet anticipated demand; and the risk that new products may have quality other defects the early stages introduction. Accordingly, the Company cannot determine advance the ultimate effect that new products will have its sales results operations. The Company\' products, from time time, experience quality problems that can result decreased net sales and operating profits. The Company sells highly complex hardware and software products that can contain defects design and manufacture.

Interest Rate Risk While the Company exposed interest rate fluctuations many the world\' leading industrialized countries, the Company\' interest income and expense most sensitive fluctuations the general level . interest rates. this regard, changes . interest rates affect the interest earned the Company\' cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments well costs associated with foreign currency hedges. The Company\' short-term investment policy and strategy ensure the preservation capital, meet liquidity requirements, and optimize return light current credit and interest rate trends. The Company benchmarks its performance utilizing external money managers manage small portion the aggregate investment portfolio. The external managers adhere the Company\' investment policies and also provide occasional research and market information that supplements internal research used make credit decisions the investment process. The Company\' exposure market risk for changes interest rates relates primarily the Company\' investment portfolio. The Company places its short-term investments highly liquid securities issued high credit quality issuers and, policy, limits the amount credit exposure any one issuer. The Company\' general policy limit the risk principal loss and ensure the safety invested funds limiting market and credit risk. All highly liquid investments with maturities three months less are classified cash equivalents; highly liquid investments with maturities greater than three months are classified short-term investments.

Except instances noted above, the Company\' policy hold investments maturity. From time time, the Company has entered into interest rate derivative transactions with financial institutions order better match the Company\' floating-rate interest income its cash equivalents ZEQ.= ,SEQ= ,EFW=" ", ="APPLE COMPUTER, INC.", =" ",CHK= ,FOLIO=\' \',FILE=\'DISK027:[04PAL0 04PAL1620]DM1620A.; \',USER=\'DNICHOL\', =\'; -DEC- ; : \' and short-term investments with its fixed-rate interest expense its debt, and diversify portion the Company\' exposure away from fluctuations short-term . interest rates. The Company did not enter into any interest rate derivatives during and had open interest rate derivatives September , . prior years, the Company had entered into interest rate debt swaps with financial institutions. The interest rate debt swaps required the Company pay floating interest rate based the three- six-month . dollar LIBOR and receive fixed rate interest without exchanges the underlying notional amounts. These swaps effectively converted the Company\' fixed-rate -year debt floating-rate debt. Due prevailing market interest rates, during and the Company entered into and then subsequently closed out interest rate debt swap positions realizing gains $ million. The gains were deferred, recognized long-term debt and were amortized other income and expense over the remaining life the debt. Foreign Currency Risk general, the Company net receiver currencies other than the . dollar. Accordingly, changes exchange rates, and particular strengthening the . dollar, may negatively affect the Company\' net sales and gross margins expressed . dollars. There also risk that the Company will have adjust local currency product pricing due competitive pressures when there has been significant volatility foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts with financial institutions protect against foreign exchange risks associated with existing assets and liabilities, certain firmly committed transactions, forecasted future cash flows, and net investments foreign subsidiaries. Generally, the Company\' practice hedge majority its existing material foreign exchange transaction exposures. However, the Company may not hedge certain foreign exchange transaction exposures due immateriality, prohibitive economic cost hedging particular exposures, and limited availability appropriate hedging instruments. order provide meaningful assessment the foreign currency risk associated with certain the Company\' foreign currency derivative positions, the Company performed sensitivity analysis using value- -risk (VAR) model assess the potential impact fluctuations exchange rates. The VAR model consisted using Monte Carlo simulation generate random market price paths. The VAR the maximum expected loss fair value, for given confidence interval, the Company\' foreign exchange portfolio due adverse movements rates. The VAR model not intended represent actual losses but used risk estimation and management tool. The model assumes normal market conditions. Forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and assets and liabilities denominated foreign currencies were excluded from the model. Based the results the model, the Company estimates with % confidence maximum one-day loss fair value $ million September , compared maximum one-day loss $ million September , . Because the Company uses foreign currency instruments for hedging purposes, losses incurred those instruments are generally offset increases the fair value the underlying exposures. Actual gains and losses the future associated with the Company\' investment portfolio and derivative positions may differ materially from the sensitivity analyses performed September , due the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes the timing and amount interest rates, foreign currency exchanges rates, and the Company\' actual exposures and positions.

Factors That May Affect Future Results and Financial Condition Because the following factors, well other factors affecting the Company\' operating results and financial condition, past financial performance should not considered reliable indicator future performance, and investors should not use historical trends anticipate results trends future periods. General economic conditions and current economic and political uncertainty could adversely affect the demand for the Company\' products and the financial health its suppliers, distributors, and resellers. The Company\' operating performance depends significantly general economic conditions the . and abroad. Over the past several years, demand for the Company\' products has been negatively impacted difficult global economic conditions. Additionally, some the Company\' education customers appeared delaying technology purchases due concerns about the overall impact the weaker economy and state budget deficits their available funding. Although recent macroeconomic trends seem indicate economic recovery, continued uncertainty about future economic conditions makes difficult forecast future demand for the Company\' products and related operating results. Should global and regional economic conditions deteriorate, demand for the Company\' products could adversely affected, could the financial health its suppliers, distributors, and resellers. War, terrorism, public health issues other business interruptions could disrupt supply, delivery demand products, which could negatively affect the Company\' operations and performance.

Because the Company does not carry earthquake insurance for direct quake-related losses, the Company\' operating results and financial condition could materially adversely affected the event major earthquake other natural manmade disaster. Although impossible predict the occurrences consequences any such events, such events could result decrease demand for the Company\' products, make difficult impossible deliver products its customers receive components from its suppliers, and could create delays and inefficiencies the Company\' supply chain. addition, should major public health issues, including epidemics, arise the Company could negatively impacted the need for more stringent employee travel restrictions, additional limitations the availability freight services, governmental actions limiting the movement products between various regions, delays production ramps new products, and disruptions the operations the Company\' manufacturing vendors and component suppliers. The Company\' operating results and financial condition have been, and the future may continue , adversely affected these events. The market for personal computers and related peripherals and services, well digital music devices and related services, highly competitive. the Company unable effectively compete these markets, its results operations could adversely affected. The personal computer industry highly competitive and characterized aggressive pricing practices, downward pressure gross margins, frequent introduction new products, short product life cycles, evolving industry standards, continual improvement product price performance characteristics, rapid adoption technological and product advancements competitors, price sensitivity the part consumers, and large number competitors.

The Company\' results operations and financial condition have been, and the future may continue , adversely affected these and other industry-wide pricing pressures and downward pressures gross margins. The personal computer industry has also been characterized rapid technological advances software functionality, hardware performance, and features based existing emerging industry standards. Further, the personal computer industry and its customers place more reliance the Internet, increasing number Internet devices that are smaller and simpler than traditional personal computers may compete for market share with the Company\' existing products. Several competitors the Company have either targeted announced their intention target certain the Company\' key market segments, including consumer, education, professional and consumer digital video editing, and design and publishing. Several the Company\' competitors have introduced announced plans introduce digital music products and online stores offering digital music distribution that mimic many the unique design, technical features, and solutions the Company\' products.

Failure may have adverse impact the Company\' operating results and financial condition. The Company must successfully manage frequent product introductions and transitions order remain competitive and effectively stimulate customer demand.

Because orders for components, and some cases commitments purchase components, must placed advance customer orders, the Company faces substantial inventory risk. The Company records write-down for inventories components and products that have become obsolete are excess anticipated demand net realizable value and accrues necessary reserves for cancellation fees orders for inventories that have been cancelled. Although the Company believes its inventory and related provisions are adequate, given the rapid and unpredictable pace product obsolescence the computer and consumer electronics industries, assurance can given that the Company will not incur additional inventory and related charges. addition, such charges have had, and may have, material effect the Company\' financial position and results operations.

Because the Company\' markets are volatile and subject rapid technology and price changes, there risk the Company will forecast incorrectly and produce order from third parties excess insufficient inventories particular products. Consistent with industry practice, components are normally acquired through combination formal purchase orders, supplier contracts, and open orders based projected demand information. Such purchase commitments typically cover the Company\' forecasted component and manufacturing requirements for periods ranging from days. The Company\' operating results and financial condition have been the past and may the future materially adversely affected the Company\' ability manage its inventory levels and respond short-term shifts customer demand patterns. Future operating results are dependent upon the Company\' ability obtain sufficient supply components, including microprocessors, some which are short supply available only from limited sources. Although most components essential the Company\' business are generally available from multiple sources, certain key components including microprocessors and ASICs are currently obtained the Company from single limited sources. Some key components (including without limitation DRAM, and TFT-LCD flat-panel displays), while currently available the Company from multiple sources, are times subject industry-wide availability and pricing pressures. addition, new products introduced the Company often initially utilize custom components obtained from only one source until the Company has evaluated whether there need for, and subsequently qualifies, additional suppliers. situations where component product utilizes new technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until such time the suppliers\' yields have matured. The Company and other producers the personal computer industry also compete for various components with other industries that have experienced increased demand for their products.
