PART Item ', 'item 1a. ': 'RISK FACTORS Our operations and financial results are subject various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect our business, financial condition, results operations, cash flows, and the trading price our common stock. face intense competition across all markets for our products and services, which may lead lower revenue operating margins. Competition the technology sector Our competitors range size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources small, specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them more effective deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers entry many our businesses are low and many the areas which compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions new products and services. Our ability remain competitive depends our success making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal businesses and consumers. Competition among platforms, ecosystems, and devices important element our business model has been create platform-based ecosystems which many participants can build diverse solutions. well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale the marketplace necessary achieve and maintain attractive margins. face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications, and services. \x95 competing vertically-integrated model, which single firm controls the software and hardware elements product and related services, has succeeded with some consumer products such personal computers, tablets, phones, gaming consoles, and wearables. Competitors pursuing this model also earn revenue from services integrated with the hardware and software platform. also offer some vertically-integrated hardware and software products and services; however, our competitors smartphones and tablets have established significantly larger user bases. Shifting portion our business vertically integrated model will increase our cost revenue and reduce our operating margins. \x95 derive substantial revenue from licenses Windows operating systems personal computers. face significant competition from competing platforms developed for new devices and form factors such smartphones and tablet computers. These devices compete multiple bases including price and the perceived utility the device and its platform. Users are increasingly turning these devices perform functions that the past were performed personal computers. Even many users view these devices complementary personal computer, the prevalence these devices may make more difficult attract application developers our operating system platforms. Competing with operating systems licensed low cost may decrease our operating system margins. addition, some our devices compete with products made our OEM partners, which may affect their commitment our platform. \x95 The success the Windows Phone platform important element our goal enhance personal productivity mobile-first and cloud-first world. The marketplace among mobile phone platforms highly competitive. may face issues selecting, engaging, securing support from operators and retailers for Windows phones due , for instance, inadequate sales training incentives, insufficient marketing support for the Windows Phone platform. \x95 Competing platforms have application marketplaces (sometimes referred \x93stores\x94) with scale and significant installed bases. The variety and utility applications available platform are important device purchasing decisions. Users incur costs move data and buy new applications when switching platforms. compete, must successfully enlist developers write applications for our marketplace and ensure that these applications have high quality, customer appeal, and value. Efforts compete with competitors\x92 application marketplaces may increase our cost revenue and lower our operating margins. PART Item Business model competition Companies compete with based growing variety business models. \x95 Even transition mobile-first and cloud-first strategy, the license-based proprietary software model generates most our software revenue. bear the costs converting original ideas into software products through investments research and development, offsetting these costs with the revenue received from licensing our products. Many our competitors also develop and sell software businesses and consumers under this model. \x95 Other competitors develop and offer free applications, online services and content, and make money selling third-party advertising. Advertising revenue funds development products and services these competitors provide users little cost, competing directly with our revenue-generating products. \x95 Some companies compete with using open source business model modifying and then distributing open source software nominal cost end-users, and earning revenue advertising complementary services and products. These firms not bear the full costs research and development for the software. Some open source software vendors develop software that mimics the features and functionality our products. The competitive pressures described above may cause decreased sales volumes, price reductions, and increased operating costs, such for research and development, marketing, and sales incentives. This may lead lower revenue, gross margins, and operating income. Our increasing focus services presents execution and competitive risks. growing part our business involves cloud-based services available across the spectrum computing devices. Our strategic vision compete and grow productivity and platform company for the mobile-first and cloud-first world. the same time, our competitors are rapidly developing and deploying cloud-based services for consumers and business customers. Pricing and delivery models are evolving. Devices and form factors influence how users access services the cloud and sometimes the user\x92 choice which suite cloud-based services use. are devoting significant resources develop and deploy our cloud-based strategies. The Windows ecosystem must continue evolve with this changing environment. are undertaking cultural and organizational changes drive accountability and eliminate obstacles innovation. The Company\x92 increasing reliance data-driven insights becoming more important the success key opportunities monetization, customer perceptions quality, and operational efficiency. Besides software development costs, are incurring costs build and maintain infrastructure support cloud computing services. These costs will reduce the operating margins have previously achieved. Whether succeed cloud-based services depends our execution several areas, including: \x95 Continuing bring market compelling cloud-based experiences that generate increasing traffic and market share. \x95 Maintaining the utility, compatibility, and performance our cloud-based services the growing array computing devices, including PCs, smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles, and other television-related devices. \x95 Continuing enhance the attractiveness our cloud platforms third-party developers. \x95 Ensuring our cloud-based services meet the reliability expectations our customers and maintain the security their data. \x95 Making our suite cloud-based services platform agnostic, available wide range devices and ecosystems, including those our competitors. uncertain whether our strategies will attract the users generate the revenue required succeed. are not effective executing organizational and technical changes increase efficiency and accelerate innovation, fail generate sufficient usage our new products and services, may not grow revenue line with the infrastructure and development investments described above. This may negatively impact gross margins and operating income. PART Item make significant investments new products and services that may not achieve expected returns. will continue make significant investments research, development, and marketing for existing products, services, and technologies, including the Windows operating system, the Microsoft Office system, Bing, Windows Phone, Windows Server, the Windows Store, the Microsoft Azure Services platform, Office , other cloud-based services offerings, and the Xbox entertainment platform. also invest the development and acquisition variety hardware for productivity, communication, and entertainment including PCs, tablets, phones, and gaming devices. Investments new technology are speculative. Commercial success depends many factors, including innovativeness, developer support, and effective distribution and marketing. customers not perceive our latest offerings providing significant new functionality other value, they may reduce their purchases new software and hardware products upgrades, unfavorably affecting revenue. may not achieve significant revenue from new product, service, and distribution channel investments for several years, all. New products and services may not profitable, and even they are profitable, operating margins for some new products and businesses will not high the margins have experienced historically. The launch Windows , with free upgrades available existing users Windows and , constitutes the most ambitious update effort have ever undertaken. have done extensive preparation and compatibility testing for applications and devices help ensure positive experience for our users installing Windows . However, users have negative upgrade experience, the community reacts negatively the process are following promote and undertake the upgrades, the reception Windows the marketplace may harmed. addition, anticipate that Windows will enable new post-license monetization opportunities beyond initial license revenues. Our failure realize these opportunities the extent expect could have adverse impact our revenues. Developing new technologies complex. can require long development and testing periods. Significant delays new releases significant problems creating new products services could adversely affect our revenue. Acquisitions, joint ventures, and strategic alliances may have adverse effect our business. expect continue making acquisitions and entering into joint ventures and strategic alliances part our long-term business strategy. These transactions and arrangements involve significant challenges and risks including that they not advance our business strategy, that get unsatisfactory return our investment, that have difficulty integrating new employees, business systems, and technology, that they distract management from our other businesses. arrangement fails adequately anticipate changing circumstances and interests party, may result early termination renegotiation the arrangement. The success these transactions and arrangements will depend part our ability leverage them enhance our existing products and services develop compelling new ones. may take longer than expected realize the full benefits from these transactions and arrangements, such increased revenue, enhanced efficiencies, increased market share, the benefits may ultimately smaller than expected. These events could adversely affect our operating results financial condition. our goodwill amortizable intangible assets become impaired may required record significant charge earnings. acquire other companies and intangible assets and may not realize all the economic benefit from those acquisitions, which could cause impairment goodwill intangibles. review our amortizable intangible assets for impairment when events changes circumstances indicate the carrying value may not recoverable. test goodwill for impairment least annually. Factors that may change circumstances, indicating that the carrying value our goodwill amortizable intangible assets may not recoverable, include decline our stock price and market capitalization, reduced future cash flow estimates, and slower growth rates industry segments which participate. may required record significant charge our consolidated financial statements during the period which any impairment our goodwill amortizable intangible assets determined, negatively affecting our results operations. For example, the fourth quarter fiscal year , recorded $ billion charge for the impairment goodwill our previous Online Services Division business (Devices and Consumer Other under our current segment structure), and the fourth quarter fiscal year , recorded $ billion charge for the impairment goodwill and $ billion charge for the impairment intangible assets our Phone Hardware segment. PART Item may not earn the revenues expect from our intellectual property rights. may not able adequately protect our intellectual property rights Protecting our global intellectual property rights and combating unlicensed copying and use our software and other intellectual property difficult. While piracy adversely affects . revenue, the impact revenue from outside the . more significant, particularly countries where laws are less protective intellectual property rights. Our revenue these markets may grow slower than the underlying device market. Similarly, the absence harmonized patent laws makes more difficult ensure consistent respect for patent rights. Throughout the world, educate consumers about the benefits licensing genuine products and obtaining indemnification benefits for intellectual property risks, and educate lawmakers about the advantages business climate where intellectual property rights are protected. Reductions the legal protection for software intellectual property rights could adversely affect revenue. may not receive expected royalties from our patent licenses expend significant resources patent the intellectual property create with the expectation that will generate revenues incorporating that intellectual property our products services , some instances, licensing our patents others return for royalty. Changes the law may weaken our ability prevent the use patented technology collect revenue for licensing our patents. These include legislative changes and regulatory actions that make more difficult obtain injunctions, and the increasing use legal process challenge issued patents. Similarly, licensees our patents may fail satisfy their obligations pay royalties, may contest the scope and extent their obligations. Finally, the royalties can obtain monetize our intellectual property may decline because the evolution technology, selling price changes products using licensed patents, the difficulty discovering infringements. Third parties may claim infringe their intellectual property rights. From time time, others claim infringe their intellectual property rights. The number these claims may grow because constant technological change the markets which compete, the extensive patent coverage existing technologies, the rapid rate issuance new patents, and our offering first-party devices, such Surface and Lumia phones. resolve these claims may enter into royalty and licensing agreements terms that are less favorable than currently available, stop selling redesign affected products services, pay damages satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers. These outcomes may cause operating margins decline. Besides money damages, some jurisdictions plaintiffs can seek injunctive relief that may limit prevent importing, marketing, and selling our products services that have infringing technologies. some countries, such Germany, injunction can issued before the parties have fully litigated the validity the underlying patents. have paid significant amounts settle claims related the use technology and intellectual property rights and procure intellectual property rights part our strategy manage this risk, and may continue . may not able protect our source code from copying there unauthorized disclosure source code. Source code, the detailed program commands for our operating systems and other software programs, critical our business. Although license portions our application and operating system source code several licensees, take significant measures protect the secrecy large portions our source code. significant portion our source code leaks, might lose future trade secret protection for that source code. may become easier for third parties compete with our products copying functionality, which could adversely affect our revenue and operating margins. Unauthorized disclosure source code also could increase the security risks described the next paragraph. PART Item Cyber-attacks and security vulnerabilities could lead reduced revenue, increased costs, liability claims, harm our competitive position. Security Microsoft\x92 information technology Threats security can take variety forms. Individual and groups hackers, and sophisticated organizations including state-sponsored organizations nation-states themselves, may take steps that pose threats our customers and our . They may develop and deploy malicious software attack our products and services and gain access our networks and datacenters, act coordinated manner launch distributed denial service other coordinated attacks. Cyber threats are constantly evolving, thereby increasing the difficulty detecting and successfully defending against them. Cyber threats can have cascading impacts that unfold with increasing speed across our internal networks and systems, and those our partners and customers. Breaches our network data security could disrupt the security our internal systems and business applications, impair our ability provide services our customers and protect the privacy their data, result product development delays, compromise confidential technical business information harming our competitive position, result theft misuse our intellectual property other assets, require allocate more resources improved technologies, otherwise adversely affect our business. addition, our internal environment continues evolve. Often are early adopters new devices and technologies. embrace new ways sharing data and communicating internally and with partners and customers using methods such social networking and other consumer-oriented technologies. Our business policies and internal security controls may not keep pace with these changes new threats emerge. Security our products, services, devices, and customers\x92 data Security threats are particular challenge companies like whose business technology products and services. Threats our own infrastructure can also affect our customers. Customers using our cloud-based services rely the security our infrastructure ensure the reliability our services and the protection their data. Hackers tend focus their efforts the most popular operating systems, programs, and services, including many ours, and expect that continue. The security our products and services important our customers\x92 purchasing decisions. defend against security threats, both our internal systems and those our customers, must continuously engineer more secure products and services, enhance security and reliability features, improve the deployment software updates address security vulnerabilities, develop mitigation technologies that help secure customers from attacks even when software updates are not deployed, maintain the digital security infrastructure that protects the integrity our network, products, and services, and provide customers security tools such firewalls and anti-virus software. The cost these steps could reduce our operating margins. fail these things well, actual perceived security vulnerabilities our products and services could harm our reputation and lead customers reduce delay future purchases products subscriptions services, use competing products services. Customers may also spend more protecting their existing computer systems from attack, which could delay adoption additional products services. Customers may fail update their systems, continue run software operating systems longer support, may fail timely install security patches. Any these actions customers could adversely affect our revenue. Actual perceived vulnerabilities may lead claims against . Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate limit our exposure liability, there assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenges. Legislative regulatory action these areas may increase the costs develop, implement, secure our products and services. Disclosure personal data could cause liability and harm our reputation. continue grow the number and scale our cloud-based offerings, store and process increasingly large amounts personally identifiable information our customers. The continued occurrence high-profile data breaches provides evidence external environment increasingly hostile information security. Despite our efforts improve the security controls across our business groups and geographies, possible our security controls over personal data, our PART Item training employees and vendors data security, and other practices follow may not prevent the improper disclosure customer data our vendors store and manage. Improper disclosure could harm our reputation, lead legal exposure customers, subject liability under laws that protect personal data, resulting increased costs loss revenue. Our software products and services also enable our customers store and process personal data -premises , increasingly, cloud-based environment host. Government authorities can sometimes require produce customer data response valid legal orders. the . and elsewhere, advocate for transparency concerning these requests and appropriate limitations government authority compel disclosure. Despite our efforts protect customer data, perceptions that the privacy personal information not satisfactorily protected could inhibit sales our products services, and could limit adoption our cloud-based solutions consumers, businesses, and government entities. Additional security measures may take address customer concerns, constraints our flexibility determine where and how operate datacenters response customer expectations governmental rules actions, may cause higher operating expenses. may have outages, data losses, and disruptions our online services fail maintain adequate operations infrastructure. Our increasing user traffic, growth services, and the complexity our products and services demand more computing power. spend substantial amounts build, purchase, lease datacenters and equipment and upgrade our technology and network infrastructure handle more traffic our websites and our datacenters. These demands continue increase introduce new products and services and support the growth existing services such Bing, Exchange Online, Office , SharePoint Online, OneDrive, Skype, Xbox Live, Microsoft Azure, Outlook com, Windows Stores, and Microsoft Account services. are rapidly growing our business providing platform and back-end hosting for services provided third parties their end users. Maintaining, securing, and expanding this infrastructure expensive and complex. requires that maintain Internet connectivity infrastructure that robust and reliable within competitive and regulatory constraints that continue evolve. Inefficiencies operational failures, including temporary permanent loss customer data insufficient Internet connectivity, could diminish the quality our products, services, and user experience resulting contractual liability, claims customers and other third parties, damage our reputation and loss current and potential users, subscribers, and advertisers, each which may harm our operating results and financial condition. Government litigation and regulatory activity relating competition rules may limit how design and market our products. leading global software and device maker, are closely scrutinized government agencies under . and foreign competition laws. increasing number governments are regulating competition law activities and this includes increased scrutiny potentially large markets such the European Union, the ., and China. Some jurisdictions also allow competitors consumers assert claims anti-competitive conduct. . federal and state antitrust authorities have previously brought enforcement actions and continue scrutinize our business. The European Commission (\x93the Commission\x94) closely scrutinizes the design high-volume Microsoft products and the terms which make certain technologies used these products, such file formats, programming interfaces, and protocols, available other companies. , the Commission ordered create new versions our Windows operating system that not include certain multimedia technologies and provide our competitors with specifications for how implement certain proprietary Windows communications protocols their own products. , the Commission accepted set commitments offered Microsoft address the Commission\x92 concerns relating competition web browsing software, including undertaking address Commission concerns relating interoperability. The web browsing commitments expired . The remaining obligations may limit our ability innovate Windows other products the future, diminish the developer appeal the Windows platform, and increase our product development costs. The availability licenses related protocols and file formats may enable competitors develop software products that better mimic the functionality our products, which could hamper sales our products. Our portfolio first-party devices continues grow; the same time our OEM partners offer large variety devices our platforms. result, increasingly both cooperate and compete with our OEM partners, creating risk that fail compliance with competition rules. Regulatory scrutiny this area may increase. Certain foreign governments, particularly China and other countries Asia, have advanced arguments under their competition laws that exert downward pressure royalties for our intellectual property. Because these jurisdictions only recently implemented competition laws, their enforcement activities are unpredictable. PART Item Government regulatory actions and court decisions such these may hinder our ability provide the benefits our software consumers and businesses, reducing the attractiveness our products and the revenue that come from them. New competition law actions could initiated. The outcome such actions, steps taken avoid them, could adversely affect variety ways, including: \x95 may have choose between withdrawing products from certain geographies avoid fines designing and developing alternative versions those products comply with government rulings, which may entail delay product release and removing functionality that customers want which developers rely. \x95 may required make available licenses our proprietary technologies terms that not reflect their fair market value not protect our associated intellectual property. \x95 The rulings described above may precedent other competition law proceedings. \x95 are subject variety ongoing commitments because court administrative orders, consent decrees, other voluntary actions have taken. fail comply with these commitments, may incur litigation costs and subject substantial fines other remedial actions. \x95 Our ability realize anticipated Windows post-sale monetization opportunities may limited. Our global operations subject potential liability under anti-corruption, trade protection, and other laws and regulations. The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and other anti-corruption laws and regulations (\x93Anti-Corruption Laws\x94) prohibit corrupt payments our employees, vendors, agents. From time time, receive inquiries from authorities the . and elsewhere about our business activities outside the . and our compliance with Anti-Corruption Laws. While devote substantial resources our global compliance programs and have implemented policies, training, and internal controls designed reduce the risk corrupt payments, our employees, vendors, agents may violate our policies. Our failure comply with Anti-Corruption Laws could result significant fines and penalties, criminal sanctions against , our officers, our employees, prohibitions the conduct our business, and damage our reputation. Operations outside the . may affected changes trade protection laws, policies, and measures, and other regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment. may subject legal liability and reputational damage sell goods services violation . trade sanctions countries such Iran, North Korea, Cuba, Sudan, and Syria. Other regulatory areas that may apply our products and online services offerings include user privacy, telecommunications, data storage and protection, and online content. For example, regulators may take the position that our offerings such Skype are covered laws regulating telecommunications services. Applying these laws and regulations our business often unclear, subject change over time, and sometimes may conflict from jurisdiction jurisdiction. Additionally, these laws and governments\x92 approach their enforcement, and our products and services, are continuing evolve. Increasing concern about government surveillance practices around the world may lead increased regulation requiring local data hosting obligations the use domestic hosting providers. Compliance with these types regulation may involve significant costs require changes products business practices that result reduced revenue. Noncompliance could result the imposition penalties orders stop the alleged noncompliant activity. Geopolitical instability may lead sanctions and impact our ability business some geographies. Our business depends our ability attract and retain talented employees. Our business based successfully attracting and retaining talented employees. The market for highly skilled workers and leaders our industry extremely competitive. are limited our ability recruit internationally restrictive domestic immigration laws. are less successful our recruiting efforts, cannot retain key employees, our ability develop and deliver successful products and services may adversely affected. Effective succession planning also important our long-term success. Failure ensure effective transfer knowledge and smooth transitions involving key employees could hinder our strategic planning and execution. have claims and lawsuits against that may result adverse outcomes. are subject variety claims and lawsuits. Adverse outcomes some all these claims may result significant monetary damages injunctive relief that could adversely affect our ability conduct our business. The litigation and other claims are PART Item subject inherent uncertainties and management\x92 view these matters may change the future. material adverse impact our consolidated financial statements could occur for the period which the effect unfavorable final outcome becomes probable and reasonably estimable. may have additional tax liabilities. are subject income taxes the . and many foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment required determining our worldwide provision for income taxes. the ordinary course our business, there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination uncertain. regularly are under audit tax authorities. Economic and political pressures increase tax revenue various jurisdictions may make resolving tax disputes favorably more difficult. Although believe our tax estimates are reasonable, the final determination tax audits and any related litigation could materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals. The results audit litigation could have material effect our consolidated financial statements the period periods which that determination made. earn significant amount our operating income from outside the ., and any repatriation funds currently held foreign jurisdictions the . may result higher effective tax rates for the company. addition, there have been proposals from Congress change . tax laws that would significantly impact how . multinational corporations are taxed foreign earnings. Although cannot predict whether what form any proposed legislation may pass, enacted, could have material adverse impact our tax expense and cash flows. Our hardware and software products may experience quality supply problems. Our vertically-integrated hardware products such Xbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other devices design, manufacture, and market are highly complex and can have defects design, manufacture, associated software. could incur significant expenses, lost revenue, and reputational harm fail detect address such issues through design, testing, warranty repairs. acquire some device components from sole suppliers. Our competitors use some the same suppliers and their demand for hardware components can affect the capacity available . component from sole-source supplier delayed becomes unavailable, whether because supplier capacity constraint industry shortages, may not obtain timely replacement supplies, resulting reduced sales. Component shortages, excess obsolete inventory, price reductions resulting inventory adjustments may increase our cost revenue. Xbox consoles, Surface devices, phones, and other hardware are assembled Asia and other geographies that may subject disruptions the supply chain, resulting shortages that would affect our revenue and operating margins. These same risks would apply any other vertically-integrated hardware and software products may offer. Our software products also may experience quality reliability problems. The highly sophisticated software products develop may contain bugs and other defects that interfere with their intended operation. Any defects not detect and fix pre-release testing could cause reduced sales and revenue, damage our reputation, repair remediation costs, delays the release new products versions, legal liability. Although our license agreements typically contain provisions that eliminate limit our exposure liability, there assurance these provisions will withstand legal challenge. Our global business exposes operational and economic risks. Our customers are located over countries and significant part our revenue comes from international sales. The global nature our business creates operational and economic risks. Emerging markets are significant focus our international growth strategy. The developing nature these markets presents several risks, including deterioration social, political, labor, economic conditions country region, and difficulties staffing and managing foreign operations. Although hedge portion our international currency exposure, significant fluctuations foreign exchange rates between the . dollar and foreign currencies may adversely affect our revenue. Competitive regulatory pressure make our pricing structure uniform might require that reduce the sales price our software the . and other countries. Catastrophic events geopolitical conditions may disrupt our business. disruption failure our systems operations because major earthquake, weather event, cyber-attack, terrorist attack, other catastrophic event could cause delays completing sales, providing services, performing other critical functions. Our corporate headquarters, significant portion our research and development activities, and certain other essential business operations are the Seattle, Washington area, and have other business operations the PART Item , , Silicon Valley area California, both which are seismically active regions. catastrophic event that results the destruction disruption any our critical business systems could harm our ability conduct normal business operations. Providing our customers with more services and solutions the cloud puts premium the resilience our systems and strength our business continuity management plans, and magnifies the potential impact prolonged service outages our operating results. Abrupt political change, terrorist activity, and armed conflict pose risk general economic disruption affected countries, which may increase our operating costs. These conditions also may add uncertainty the timing and budget for technology investment decisions our customers, and may cause supply chain disruptions for hardware manufacturers, either which may adversely affect our revenue. The long-term effects climate change the global economy the industry particular are unclear. Environmental regulations changes the supply, demand available sources energy other natural resources may affect the availability cost goods and services, including natural resources, necessary run our business. Changes weather where operate may increase the costs powering and cooling computer hardware use develop software and provide cloud-based services. Adverse economic market conditions may harm our business. Worsening economic conditions, including inflation, recession, other changes economic conditions, may cause lower spending and adversely affect our revenue. demand for PCs, servers, and other computing devices declines, consumer business spending for those products declines, our revenue will adversely affected. Substantial revenue comes from our . government contracts. extended federal government shutdown resulting from failing pass budget appropriations, adopt continuing funding resolutions raise the debt ceiling, and other budgetary decisions limiting delaying federal government spending, could reduce government spending our products and services and adversely affect our revenue. Our product distribution system relies extensive partner and retail network. OEMs building devices that run our software have also been significant means distribution. The impact economic conditions our partners, such the bankruptcy major distributor, OEM, retailer, could cause sales channel disruption. Challenging economic conditions also may impair the ability our customers pay for products and services they have purchased. result, allowances for doubtful accounts and write-offs accounts receivable may increase. maintain investment portfolio various holdings, types, and maturities. These investments are subject general credit, liquidity, market, and interest rate risks, which may exacerbated unusual events that affect global financial markets. significant part our investment portfolio comprises . government securities. global credit and equity markets decline for long periods, there downgrade the . government credit rating due actual threatened default government debt, our investment portfolio may adversely affected and could determine that more our investments have experienced other-than-temporary decline fair value, requiring impairment charges that could adversely affect our financial results.

Broker pricing used mainly when quoted price not available, the investment not priced our pricing vendors, when broker price more reflective fair values the market which the investment trades. Our broker-priced investments are generally classified Level investments because the broker prices these investments based similar assets without applying significant adjustments. addition, all our broker-priced investments have sufficient level trading volume demonstrate that the fair values used are appropriate for these investments. Our fair value processes include controls that are designed ensure appropriate fair values are recorded. These controls include model validation, review key model inputs, analysis period-over-period fluctuations, and independent recalculation prices where appropriate.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE See Note \x96 Accounting Policies the Notes Financial Statements (Part , Item this Form - ) for further discussion. APPLICATION CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared accordance with . GAAP. Preparing consolidated financial statements requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. These estimates and assumptions are affected management\x92 application accounting policies. Critical accounting policies for include revenue recognition, impairment investment securities, goodwill, research and development costs, contingencies, income taxes, and inventories. Revenue Recognition Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment determine multiple elements exist, whether elements can accounted for separate units accounting, and , the fair value for each the elements. Judgment also required assess whether future releases certain software represent new products upgrades and enhancements existing products. Certain volume licensing arrangements include perpetual license for current products combined with rights receive unspecified future versions software products and are accounted for subscriptions, with billings recorded unearned revenue and recognized revenue ratably over the coverage period. PART Item Software updates are evaluated case- -case basis determine whether they meet the definition upgrade, which may require revenue deferred and recognized when the upgrade delivered. determined that implied post-contract customer support (\x93PCS\x94) being provided, revenue from the arrangement deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term. updates are determined not meet the definition upgrade, revenue generally recognized products are shipped made available. Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different periods time, and when allowed under . GAAP, revenue allocated the respective elements based their relative selling prices the inception the arrangement, and revenue recognized each element delivered. use hierarchy determine the fair value used for allocating revenue elements: ( ) vendor-specific objective evidence fair value (\x93VSOE\x94), ( ) third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate selling price (\x93ESP\x94). For software elements, follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use VSOE establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE the price charged when the deliverable sold separately the price established management for product that not yet sold probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established best estimates what the selling prices would the deliverables were sold regularly stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related each deliverable. January , announced Windows will free all qualified existing users Windows and Windows . This offer differs from historical offers preceding the launch new versions Windows being made available for free existing users addition new customers after the offer announcement. evaluated the nature and accounting treatment the Windows offer and determined that represents marketing and promotional activity, part because the offer being made available for free existing users. this marketing and promotional activity, revenue recognition new sales Windows will continue recognized delivered. Impairment Investment Securities review investments quarterly for indicators other-than-temporary impairment. This determination requires significant judgment. making this judgment, employ systematic methodology quarterly that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence evaluating potential impairment our investments. the cost investment exceeds its fair value, evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent which the fair value less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability hold, plans sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, also evaluate whether have plans sell the security more likely than not that will required sell the security before recovery. also consider specific adverse conditions related the financial health and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once decline fair value determined other-than-temporary, impairment charge recorded other income (expense), net and new cost basis the investment established. market, industry, and investee conditions deteriorate, may incur future impairments. Goodwill allocate goodwill reporting units based the reporting unit expected benefit from the business combination. evaluate our reporting units annual basis and, necessary, reassign goodwill using relative fair value allocation approach. Goodwill tested for impairment the reporting unit level (operating segment one level below operating segment) annual basis (May for ) and between annual tests event occurs circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value reporting unit below its carrying value. These events circumstances could include significant change the business climate, legal factors, operating performance indicators, competition, sale disposition significant portion reporting unit. Application the goodwill impairment test requires judgment, including the identification reporting units, assignment assets and liabilities reporting units, assignment goodwill reporting units, and determination the fair value each reporting unit. The fair value each reporting unit estimated primarily through the use PART Item discounted cash flow methodology. This analysis requires significant judgments, including estimation future cash flows, which dependent internal forecasts, estimation the long-term rate growth for our business, estimation the useful life over which cash flows will occur, and determination our weighted average cost capital. The estimates used calculate the fair value reporting unit change from year year based operating results, market conditions, and other factors. Changes these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination fair value and goodwill impairment for each reporting unit. Based the results our annual goodwill impairment testing May , , determined that goodwill associated with our Phone Hardware reporting unit was impaired, resulting material charge earnings the fourth quarter fiscal year . June , , none our reporting units were considered risk impairment. Research and Development Costs Costs incurred internally researching and developing computer software product are charged expense until technological feasibility has been established for the product. Once technological feasibility established, all software costs are capitalized until the product available for general release customers. Judgment required determining when technological feasibility product established. have determined that technological feasibility for our software products reached after all high-risk development issues have been resolved through coding and testing. Generally, this occurs shortly before the products are released manufacturing. The amortization these costs included cost revenue over the estimated life the products. Legal and Other Contingencies The outcomes legal proceedings and claims brought against are subject significant uncertainty. estimated loss from loss contingency such legal proceeding claim accrued charge income probable that asset has been impaired liability has been incurred and the amount the loss can reasonably estimated. determining whether loss should accrued evaluate, among other factors, the degree probability unfavorable outcome and the ability make reasonable estimate the amount loss. Changes these factors could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. Income Taxes The objectives accounting for income taxes are recognize the amount taxes payable refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences events that have been recognized entity\x92 financial statements tax returns. recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax position only more likely than not that the tax position will sustained examination the taxing authorities, based the technical merits the position. The tax benefits recognized the financial statements from such position are measured based the largest benefit that has greater than % likelihood being realized upon ultimate settlement. Accounting literature also provides guidance derecognition income tax assets and liabilities, classification current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties associated with tax positions, and income tax disclosures. Judgment required assessing the future tax consequences events that have been recognized our consolidated financial statements tax returns. Variations the actual outcome these future tax consequences could materially impact our consolidated financial statements. PART Item Inventories Inventories are stated average cost, subject the lower cost market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related the purchase and production inventories. regularly review inventory quantities hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility our inventory. These reviews include analysis demand forecasts, product life cycle status, product development plans, current sales levels, pricing strategy, and component cost trends. our review indicates reduction utility below carrying value, reduce our inventory new cost basis through charge cost revenue. The determination market value and the estimated volume demand used the lower cost market analysis require significant judgment.

GAAP\x94). have recast certain prior period amounts conform the current period presentation, with impact consolidated net income cash flows. Principles Consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which are able exercise significant influence over but not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary the investee\x92 activities are accounted for using the equity method. Investments through which are not able exercise significant influence over the investee and which not have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost method. Estimates and Assumptions Preparing financial statements requires management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples estimates include: loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value , and potential impairment goodwill and intangibles assets, for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples assumptions include: the elements comprising software arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility achieved for our products; the potential outcome future tax consequences events that have been recognized our consolidated financial statements tax returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management\x92 estimates and assumptions. Foreign Currencies Assets and liabilities recorded foreign currencies are translated the exchange rate the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated average rates exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are recorded other comprehensive income (\x93OCI\x94). Revenue Recognition Revenue recognized when persuasive evidence arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the fee fixed determinable, and collectability probable. Revenue generally recognized net allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted governmental authorities. Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment determine multiple elements exist, whether elements can accounted for separate units accounting, and , the fair value for each the elements. Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different periods time, and when allowed under . GAAP, revenue allocated the respective elements based their relative selling prices the inception the arrangement, and revenue recognized each element delivered. use hierarchy determine the fair value used for allocating revenue elements: ( ) vendor-specific objective evidence fair value (\x93VSOE\x94), ( ) third-party evidence, PART Item and (iii) best estimate selling price (\x93ESP\x94). For software elements, follow the industry specific software guidance which only allows for the use VSOE establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE the price charged when the deliverable sold separately the price established management for product that not yet sold probable that the price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are established best estimates what the selling prices would the deliverables were sold regularly stand-alone basis. Our process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related each deliverable. Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed original equipment manufacturers (\x93OEMs\x94), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally recognized products are shipped made available. Technology guarantee programs are accounted for multiple-element arrangements customers receive free significantly discounted rights use upcoming new versions software product they license existing versions the product during the eligibility period. Revenue allocated between the existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated the new product deferred until that version delivered. The revenue allocation based the VSOE fair value the products. The VSOE fair value for upcoming new products are based the price determined management having the relevant authority when the element not yet sold separately, but expected sold the near future the price set management. Software updates that will provided free charge are evaluated case- -case basis determine whether they meet the definition upgrade and create multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue deferred and recognized when the upgrade delivered, determined that implied post-contract customer support (\x93PCS\x94) being provided, the arrangement accounted for multiple-element arrangement and all revenue from the arrangement deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term when the VSOE fair value does not exist. updates are determined not meet the definition upgrade, revenue generally recognized products are shipped made available. Certain volume licensing arrangements include perpetual license for current products combined with rights receive unspecified future versions software products, which have determined are additional software products and are therefore accounted for subscriptions, with billings recorded unearned revenue and recognized revenue ratably over the coverage period. Arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products with the right use unspecified future versions the software during the coverage period, are also accounted for subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage period. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for the use hosted software product service over contractually determined period time without taking possession software are accounted for subscriptions with billings recorded unearned revenue and recognized revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning the date the service made available customers. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that are provided consumption basis (for example, the amount storage used particular period) recognized commensurate with the customer utilization such resources. Some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based services and software offerings that are accounted for subscriptions. These arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. However, because all elements are accounted for subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue recognition timing. Revenue related phones, Surface devices, Xbox consoles, games published , and other hardware components generally recognized when ownership transferred the resellers end customers when selling directly through Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. portion revenue may deferred when these products are combined with software elements, and services. Revenue related licensing for games published third parties for use the Xbox consoles recognized when games are manufactured the game publishers. Display advertising revenue recognized advertisements are displayed. Search advertising revenue recognized when the appears the search results when the action necessary earn the revenue has been PART Item completed. Consulting services revenue recognized services are rendered, generally based the negotiated hourly rate the consulting arrangement and the number hours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements recognized services are provided. Revenue from prepaid points redeemable for the purchase software services recognized upon redemption the points and delivery the software services. Cost Revenue Cost revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; operating costs related product support service centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred include software PCs sold OEMs, drive traffic our websites, and acquire online advertising space; costs incurred support and maintain Internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery consulting services; and the amortization capitalized software development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated lives the products. Product Warranty provide for the estimated costs fulfilling our obligations under hardware and software warranties the time the related revenue recognized. For hardware warranties, estimate the costs based historical and projected product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge specific product failures ( any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country which business, but generally include parts and labor over period generally ranging from days three years. For software warranties, estimate the costs provide bug fixes, such security patches, over the estimated life the software. regularly reevaluate our estimates assess the adequacy the recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts necessary. Research and Development Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with product development. Research and development expenses also include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs incurred translate software for international markets, and the amortization purchased software code and services content. Such costs related software development are included research and development expense until the point that technological feasibility reached, which for our software products, generally shortly before the products are released manufacturing. Once technological feasibility reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized cost revenue over the estimated lives the products. Sales and Marketing Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed incurred. Advertising expense was $ billion, $ billion, and $ billion fiscal years , , and , respectively. Stock-Based Compensation measure stock-based compensation cost the grant date based the fair value the award and recognize expense, net estimated forfeitures, over the vesting service period, applicable, the stock award (generally four five years) using the straight-line method. PART Item Employee Stock Purchase Plan Shares our common stock may purchased employees three-month intervals % the fair market value the stock the last day each three-month period. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan measured the discount the employee entitled upon purchase and recognized the period purchase. Income Taxes Income tax expense includes . and international income taxes, the provision for . taxes undistributed earnings international subsidiaries not deemed permanently invested, and interest and penalties uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported tax returns and financial statements the same year. The tax effect such temporary differences reported deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net valuation allowance when more likely than not that tax benefit will not realized. The deferred income taxes are classified current long-term based the classification the related asset liability. Fair Value Measurements account for certain assets and liabilities fair value. The hierarchy below lists three levels fair value based the extent which inputs used measuring fair value are observable the market. categorize each our fair value measurements one these three levels based the lowest level input that significant the fair value measurement its entirety. These levels are: \x95 Level \x96 inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments traded active markets. Our Level non-derivative investments primarily include . government securities, domestic and international equities, and actively traded mutual funds. Our Level derivative assets and liabilities include those actively traded exchanges. \x95 Level \x96 inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments active markets, quoted prices for identical similar instruments markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques ( . the Black-Scholes model) for which all significant inputs are observable the market can corroborated observable market data for substantially the full term the assets liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, and forward and spot prices for currencies and commodities. Our Level non-derivative investments consist primarily corporate notes and bonds, common and preferred stock, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, . government and agency securities, and foreign government bonds. Our Level derivative assets and liabilities primarily include certain over-the-counter option and swap contracts. \x95 Level \x96 inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\x92 estimates assumptions that market participants would use pricing the asset liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our Level non-derivative assets primarily comprise investments common and preferred stock and goodwill when recorded fair value due impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used the models are significant the fair values the assets and liabilities. Our Level derivative assets and liabilities primarily include equity derivatives. measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, fair value nonrecurring basis when they are deemed other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values these investments are determined based valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. impairment charge recorded when the cost the investment exceeds its fair value and this condition determined other-than-temporary. Our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying values. PART Item Financial Instruments consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with maturity three months less the date purchase cash equivalents. The fair values these investments approximate their carrying values. general, investments with original maturities greater than three months and remaining maturities less than one year are classified short-term investments. Investments with maturities beyond one year may classified short-term based their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities represent the investment cash that available for current operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected OCI. Equity and other investments classified long-term include both debt and equity instruments. With the exception certain corporate notes that are classified held- -maturity, debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes the market value available-for-sale securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected OCI. Held- -maturity investments are recorded and held amortized cost. Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more than one year are not publicly traded are recorded cost using the equity method. lend certain fixed-income and equity securities increase investment returns. The loaned securities continue carried investments our balance sheet. Cash and security interests are received collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness the borrower. Cash received recorded asset with corresponding liability. Investments are considered impaired when decline fair value judged other-than-temporary. Fair value calculated based publicly available market information other estimates determined management. employ systematic methodology quarterly basis that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence evaluating potential impairment our investments. the cost investment exceeds its fair value, evaluate, among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality debt instrument issuers, the duration and extent which the fair value less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability hold, plans sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, also evaluate whether have plans sell the security more likely than not that will required sell the security before recovery. also consider specific adverse conditions related the financial health and business outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once decline fair value determined other-than-temporary, impairment charge recorded other income (expense), net and new cost basis the investment established. Derivative instruments are recognized either assets liabilities and are measured fair value. The accounting for changes the fair value derivative depends the intended use the derivative and the resulting designation. For derivative instruments designated fair value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized earnings the periods change together with the offsetting losses (gains) the hedged items attributed the risk being hedged. For options designated fair value hedges, changes the time value are excluded from the assessment hedge effectiveness and are recognized earnings. For derivative instruments designated cash-flow hedges, the effective portion the gains (losses) the derivatives initially reported component OCI and subsequently recognized earnings when the hedged exposure recognized earnings. For options designated cash-flow hedges, changes the time value are excluded from the assessment hedge effectiveness and are recognized earnings. Gains (losses) derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the assessment effectiveness hedge ineffectiveness are recognized earnings. For derivative instruments that are not designated hedges, gains (losses) from changes fair values are primarily recognized other income (expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment PART Item purposes, such commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset unrealized gains (losses) the underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded component OCI until the securities are sold other-than-temporarily impaired, which time the amounts are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (\x93AOCI\x94) into other income (expense), net.
