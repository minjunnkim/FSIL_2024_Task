Additionally, because many our supply contracts have volume-based pricing minimum purchase requirements, the volume our hardware sales decreases does not reach projected targets, could face increased materials and manufacturing costs other financial liabilities that could make our hardware products more costly per unit manufacture and therefore less competitive and negatively impact our financial results. Further, certain our competitors may negotiate more favorable contractual terms based volume and other commitments that may provide them with competitive advantages and may impact our supply. also require our suppliers and business partners comply with law and company policies regarding workplace and employment practices, data security, environmental compliance and intellectual property licensing, but not control them their practices. any them violates laws implements practices regarded unethical, could experience supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations damage key relationships, and damage our reputation. any them fails procure necessary license rights third-party intellectual property, legal action could ensue that could impact the saleability our products and expose financial obligations third parties. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act includes disclosure requirements regarding the use certain minerals mined from the Democratic Republic Congo and adjoining countries (DRC) and procedures pertaining manufacturer' efforts regarding the source such minerals.

Our products and services depend the ability our users access the Internet, and certain our products require significant bandwidth work effectively. Currently, this access provided companies that have significant market power the broadband and internet access marketplace, including incumbent telephone companies, cable companies, mobile communications companies, and government-owned service providers. Some these providers have taken, have stated that they may take measures, including legal actions, that could degrade, disrupt, increase the cost user access certain our products restricting prohibiting the use their infrastructure support facilitate our offerings, charging increased fees our users provide our offerings. addition, some jurisdictions, our products and services have been subject government-initiated restrictions blockages. Such interference could result loss existing users and advertisers, and increased costs, and could impair our ability attract new users and advertisers, thereby harming our revenues and growth. New technologies could block online ads, which would harm our Google business.

Fair Value Financial Instruments Our financial assets and financial liabilities that include cash equivalents, marketable securities, foreign currency and interest rate derivative contracts, and non-marketable debt securities are measured and recorded fair value recurring basis. measure certain financial assets fair value for disclosure purposes, well , nonrecurring basis when they are deemed other-than-temporarily impaired. Our other current financial assets and our other current financial liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying value. Fair value exit price, representing the amount that would received sell asset paid transfer liability orderly transaction between market participants. such, fair value market-based measurement that determined based assumptions that market participants would use pricing asset liability. Assets and liabilities recorded fair value are measured and classified accordance with three-tier fair value hierarchy based the observability the inputs available the market used measure fair value: Level - Observable inputs that reflect quoted prices (unadjusted) for identical assets liabilities active markets. Level - Include other inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments active markets, quoted prices for identical similar instruments markets that are not active, and model-based valuation techniques for which all significant inputs are observable the market can derived from observable market data. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows and discount the future amounts present value using market-based observable inputs including interest rate curves, foreign exchange rates, and credit ratings. Level - Unobservable inputs that are supported little market activities. The fair value hierarchy requires entity maximize the use observable inputs and minimize the use unobservable inputs when measuring fair value. Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities invest all excess cash primarily debt securities including those the . government and its agencies, corporate debt securities, agency mortgage-backed securities, money market and other funds, municipal securities, time deposits, asset backed securities, and debt instruments issued foreign governments. classify all investments that are readily convertible known amounts cash and have stated maturities three months less from the date purchase cash equivalents and those with stated maturities greater than three months marketable securities. determine the appropriate classification our investments marketable securities the time purchase and reevaluate such designation each balance sheet date. have classified and accounted for our marketable securities available-for-sale.

Non-Marketable Investments have accounted for non-marketable equity investments either under the equity cost method. Investments through which exercise significant influence but not have control over the investee are accounted for under the equity method. Investments through which are not able exercise significant influence over the investee are accounted for under the cost method. Alphabet Inc. and Google Inc. have accounted for our non-marketable investments that meet the definition debt security available-for-sale securities. Since these securities not have contractual maturity dates and not intend liquidate them the next months, have classified them non-current assets the accompanying Consolidated Balance Sheet. Variable Interest Entities make determination the start each arrangement whether entity which have made investment considered Variable Interest Entity (“VIE”). consolidate VIEs which have controlling financial interest. not have controlling financial interest VIE, account for the investment under either the equity cost method. Impairment Marketable and Non-Marketable Investments periodically review our marketable and non-marketable investments for impairment. conclude that any these investments are impaired, determine whether such impairment other-than-temporary. Factors consider make such determination include the duration and severity the impairment, the reason for the decline value and the potential recovery period and our intent sell. For debt securities, also consider whether ( ) more likely than not that will required sell the security before recovery its amortized cost basis, and ( ) the amortized cost basis cannot recovered result credit losses. any impairment considered other-than-temporary, will write down the asset its fair value and record the corresponding charge other income (expense), net. Accounts Receivable record accounts receivable the invoiced amount and normally not charge interest. maintain allowance for doubtful accounts reserve for potentially uncollectible receivables. review the accounts receivable amounts due customers which are past due identify specific customers with known disputes collectability issues. determining the amount the reserve, make judgments about the creditworthiness significant customers based ongoing credit evaluations. also maintain sales allowance reserve for potential credits issued customers. determine the amount the reserve based historical credits issued. Property and Equipment account for property and equipment cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. compute depreciation using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives the assets, generally two five years. depreciate buildings over periods years. amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter the remaining lease term the estimated useful lives the assets. Construction progress the construction development property and equipment that have not yet been placed service for our intended use. Depreciation for equipment commences once placed service and depreciation for buildings and leasehold improvements commences once they are ready for our intended use. Land not depreciated. Software Development Costs expense software development costs, including costs develop software products the software component products marketed external users, before technological feasibility reached. Technological feasibility typically reached shortly before the release such products and result, development costs that meet the criteria for capitalization were not material for the periods presented. Software development costs also include costs develop software used solely meet internal needs and cloud based applications used deliver our services. capitalize development costs related these software applications once the preliminary project stage complete and probable that the project will completed and the software will used perform the function intended.

Net Income Per Share Alphabet compute net income per share Class and Class common stock and Class capital stock using the two-class method. Basic net income per share computed using the weighted-average number common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted net income per share computed using the weighted-average number common shares and the effect potentially dilutive securities outstanding during the period. Potentially dilutive securities consist stock options, restricted stock units, and other contingently issuable shares. The dilutive effect outstanding stock options, restricted stock units, and other contingently issuable shares reflected diluted earnings per share application the treasury stock method. The computation the diluted net income per share Class common stock assumes the conversion Class common stock, while the diluted net income per share Class common stock does not assume the conversion those shares.
