Our user growth, engagement, and monetization mobile devices depend upon effective operation with mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that not control. There guarantee that popular mobile devices will continue feature Facebook our other products, that mobile device users will continue use our products rather than competing products. are dependent the interoperability Facebook and our other products with popular mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that not control, such the Android and iOS operating systems. Any changes such systems, changes our relationships with mobile operating system partners, handset manufacturers, mobile carriers, their terms service policies that degrade our products\' functionality, reduce eliminate our ability distribute our products, give preferential treatment competitive products, limit our ability deliver, target, measure the effectiveness ads, charge fees related the distribution our products our delivery ads could adversely affect the usage Facebook our other products and monetization mobile devices.

Competition presents ongoing threat the success our business. face significant competition every aspect our business, including from companies that provide tools facilitate communication and the sharing information, companies that enable marketers display advertising and companies that provide development platforms for applications developers. compete with companies that offer products that replicate the full range capabilities provide. For example, Google has integrated social functionality into number its products, including search and Android, well other, largely regional, social networks that have strong positions particular countries. also compete with companies that develop applications, particularly mobile applications, that provide social other communications functionality, such messaging, photo- and video-sharing, and micro-blogging, and companies that provide web- and mobile-based information and entertainment products and services that are designed engage users and capture time spent mobile devices and online. addition, face competition from traditional, online, and mobile businesses that provide media for marketers reach their audiences and develop tools and systems for managing and optimizing advertising campaigns. Some our current and potential competitors may have significantly greater resources better competitive positions certain product segments, geographic regions user demographics than . These factors may allow our competitors respond more effectively than new emerging technologies and changes market conditions. believe that some our users, particularly our younger users, are aware and actively engaging with other products and services similar , substitute for, Facebook products and services, and believe that some our users have reduced their engagement with Facebook favor increased engagement with these other products and services. the event that our users increasingly engage with other products and services, may experience decline user engagement key user demographics more broadly, which case our business would likely harmed. Our competitors may develop products, features, services that are similar ours that achieve greater acceptance, may undertake more far-reaching and successful product development efforts marketing campaigns, may adopt more aggressive pricing policies. addition, developers whose mobile and web applications are integrated with Facebook may use information shared our users through Facebook order develop products features that compete with . Certain competitors, including Google, could use strong dominant positions one more markets gain competitive advantage against areas where operate, including: integrating competing platforms, applications, features into products they control such mobile device operating systems, search engines, web browsers; making acquisitions; limiting denying our access advertising measurement delivery systems; limiting our ability deliver, target, measure the effectiveness ads; imposing fees other charges related our delivery ads; making access our products more difficult; making more difficult communicate with our users. result, our competitors may acquire and engage users generate advertising other revenue the expense our own efforts, which may negatively affect our business and financial results. addition, from time time, may take actions response competitive threats, but cannot assure you that these actions will successful that they will not negatively affect our business and financial results. believe that our ability compete effectively depends upon many factors both within and beyond our control, including: • the popularity, usefulness, ease use, performance, and reliability our products compared our competitors\' products, particularly with respect mobile products; • the size and composition our user base; • the engagement our users with our products and competing products; • the timing and market acceptance products, including developments and enhancements our our competitors\' products; • our ability distribute our products new and existing users; • our ability monetize our products; • the frequency, size, format, quality, and relative prominence the ads displayed our competitors; • customer service and support efforts; • marketing and selling efforts, including our ability measure the effectiveness our ads and provide marketers with compelling return their investments; • our ability establish and maintain developers\' interest building mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products; • our ability establish and maintain publisher interest integrating their content with Facebook and our other products; • changes mandated legislation, regulatory authorities, litigation, including settlements and consent decrees, some which may have disproportionate effect ; • acquisitions consolidation within our industry, which may result more formidable competitors; • our ability attract, retain, and motivate talented employees, particularly software engineers, designers, and product managers; • our ability cost-effectively manage and grow our operations; and • our reputation and brand strength relative those our competitors. are not able compete effectively, our user base and level user engagement may decrease, may become less attractive developers and marketers, and our revenue and results operations may materially and adversely affected. Action governments restrict access Facebook our other products their countries could substantially harm our business and financial results. possible that governments one more countries may seek censor content available Facebook our other products their country, restrict access our products from their country entirely, impose other restrictions that may affect the accessibility our products their country for extended period time indefinitely.

Our new products and changes existing products could fail attract retain users generate revenue and profits. Our ability retain, increase, and engage our user base and increase our revenue depends heavily our ability create successful new products, both independently and conjunction with developers other third parties. may introduce significant changes our existing products, acquire introduce new and unproven products, including using technologies with which have little prior development operating experience. For example, July acquired Oculus , Inc. (Oculus), company developing virtual reality technology. not have prior experience with consumer hardware products virtual reality technology, which may adversely affect our ability successfully develop and market Oculus\' products technology, and will incur increased costs connection with the development and marketing such products and technology. addition, October , acquired WhatsApp Inc. (WhatsApp), and have also invested significant resources growing Messenger. have historically monetized messaging only very limited fashion, and may not successful our efforts generate meaningful revenue from messaging over the long term. these other new enhanced products fail engage users, marketers, developers, are unsuccessful our monetization efforts, may fail attract retain users generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, other value justify our investments, and our business may adversely affected. make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results. frequently make product and investment decisions that may not prioritize short-term financial results believe that the decisions are consistent with our mission and benefit the aggregate user experience and will thereby improve our financial performance over the long term. For example, from time time may change the size, frequency, relative prominence ads order improve quality and overall user experience. Similarly, from time time update our News Feed ranking algorithm deliver the most relevant content our users, which may adversely affect the distribution content marketers and developers and could reduce their incentive invest their development and marketing efforts Facebook. also may introduce changes existing products, introduce new stand-alone products, that direct users away from properties where have proven means monetization. For example, have taken action redirect users who send messages from within the Facebook application our stand-alone Messenger application, although not monetize the stand-alone Messenger application any significant manner. addition, plan continue focusing growing the user base for WhatsApp and potentially other stand-alone applications that may have limited near-term monetization, and possible that these efforts may reduce engagement with the core Facebook application. also may take steps that result limiting distribution mobile products and services the short term order attempt ensure the availability our products and services users over the long term. These decisions may not produce the long-term benefits that expect, which case our user growth and engagement, our relationships with marketers and developers, and our business and results operations could harmed. are not able maintain and enhance our brands, events occur that damage our reputation and brands, our ability expand our base users, marketers, and developers may impaired, and our business and financial results may harmed. believe that our brands have significantly contributed the success our business. also believe that maintaining and enhancing our brands critical expanding our base users, marketers, and developers. Many our new users are referred existing users. Maintaining and enhancing our brands will depend largely our ability continue provide useful, reliable, trustworthy, and innovative products, which may not successfully. may introduce new products terms service policies that users not like, which may negatively affect our brands. Additionally, the actions our developers may affect our brands users not have positive experience using third-party mobile and web applications integrated with Facebook. will also continue experience media, legislative, regulatory scrutiny our decisions regarding user privacy and other issues, which may adversely affect our reputation and brands. also may fail provide adequate customer service, which could erode confidence our brands.

Such attacks may cause interruptions the services provide, degrade the user experience, cause users lose confidence our products, result financial harm . Our efforts protect our company data the information receive may also unsuccessful due software bugs other technical malfunctions, employee error malfeasance, government surveillance, other factors. addition, third parties may attempt fraudulently induce employees users disclose information order gain access our data our users\' data. Although have developed systems and processes that are designed protect our data and user data and prevent data loss and other security breaches, cannot assure you that such measures will provide absolute security. addition, some our developers other partners, such those that help measure the effectiveness ads, may receive store information provided our users through mobile web applications integrated with Facebook. provide limited information such third parties based the scope services provided . However, these third parties developers fail adopt adhere adequate data security practices, the event breach their networks, our data our users\' data may improperly accessed, used, disclosed. Affected users government authorities could initiate legal regulatory actions against connection with any security breaches improper disclosure data, which could cause incur significant expense and liability result orders consent decrees forcing modify our business practices. Any these events could have material and adverse effect our business, reputation, financial results. Unfavorable media coverage could negatively affect our business. receive high degree media coverage around the world.

Such negative publicity also could have adverse effect the size, engagement, and loyalty our user base and result decreased revenue, which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Our financial results will fluctuate from quarter quarter and are difficult predict. Our quarterly financial results have fluctuated the past and will fluctuate the future. Additionally, have limited operating history with the current scale our business, which makes difficult forecast our future results. result, you should not rely upon our past quarterly financial results indicators future performance. You should take into account the risks and uncertainties frequently encountered companies rapidly evolving markets. Our financial results any given quarter can influenced numerous factors, many which are unable predict are outside our control, including: • our ability maintain and grow our user base and user engagement; • our ability attract and retain marketers particular period; • fluctuations spending our marketers due seasonality, such historically strong spending the fourth quarter each year, other factors; • the frequency, prominence, size, format, and quality ads shown users; • the pricing our ads and other products; • our ability maintain increase Payments and other fees revenue; • the diversification and growth revenue sources beyond advertising Facebook; • the development and introduction new products services our competitors; • increases marketing, sales, and other operating expenses that will incur grow and expand our operations and remain competitive; • our ability maintain gross margins and operating margins; • costs related acquisitions, including costs associated with amortization and additional investments develop the acquired technologies; • charges associated with impairment any assets our balance sheet; • our ability obtain equipment and components for our data centers and other technical infrastructure timely and cost-effective manner; • system failures outages, which could prevent from serving ads for any period time; • breaches security privacy, and the costs associated with any such breaches and remediation; • changes the manner which distribute our products inaccessibility our products due third-party actions; • fees paid third parties for content the distribution our products; • share-based compensation expense, including acquisition-related expense; • adverse litigation judgments, settlements, other litigation-related costs; • changes the legislative regulatory environment, including with respect privacy and data protection, enforcement government regulators, including fines, orders, consent decrees; • the overall tax rate for our business, which may affected number factors, including the financial results our international subsidiaries and the timing, size, and integration acquisitions may make from time time; • tax obligations that may arise from changes laws resolutions tax examinations that materially differ from the amounts have anticipated; • fluctuations currency exchange rates and changes the proportion our revenue and expenses denominated foreign currencies; • fluctuations the market values our portfolio investments and interest rates; • changes . generally accepted accounting principles; and • changes global business macroeconomic conditions. expect our rates growth decline the future. expect that our user growth and revenue growth rates will decline over time the size our active user base increases and achieve greater market penetration. For example, the growth rate our revenue declined from % from , % from . expect our revenue growth rate will generally decline over time our revenue increases higher levels. our growth rates decline, investors\' perceptions our business may adversely affected and the trading price our Class common stock could decline. Our costs are continuing grow, which could harm our business and profitability. Operating our business costly, and expect our expenses continue increase the future broaden our user base, users increase the amount content they consume and the data they share with , develop and implement new products, and continue hire additional employees support our expanding operations. expect continue invest our global connectivity efforts, which may not have clear path monetization. may also subject increased costs order obtain and attract third-party content facilitate the distribution our products. addition, will incur increased costs connection with the development and marketing our Oculus products. Any such investments may not successful, and any such increases our costs may adversely affect our business and profitability. Our business subject complex and evolving . and foreign laws and regulations regarding privacy, data protection, and other matters. Many these laws and regulations are subject change and uncertain interpretation, and could result claims, changes our business practices, monetary penalties, increased cost operations, declines user growth engagement, otherwise harm our business. are subject variety laws and regulations the United States and abroad that involve matters central our business, including privacy and data protection, rights publicity, content, intellectual property, advertising, marketing, distribution, data security, data retention and deletion, personal information, electronic contracts and other communications, competition, protection minors, consumer protection, telecommunications, product liability, taxation, economic other trade prohibitions sanctions, securities law compliance, and online payment services. The introduction new products expansion our activities certain jurisdictions may subject additional laws and regulations. addition, foreign data protection, privacy, and other laws and regulations can more restrictive than those the United States. These . federal and state and foreign laws and regulations, which some cases can enforced private parties addition government entities, are constantly evolving and can subject significant change. result, the application, interpretation, and enforcement these laws and regulations are often uncertain, particularly the new and rapidly evolving industry which operate, and may interpreted and applied inconsistently from country country and inconsistently with our current policies and practices.

Such actions could affect the manner which provide our services adversely affect our financial results. are also subject laws and regulations that dictate whether, how, and under what circumstances can transfer, process and receive transnational data that critical our operations, including data relating users, customers, partners outside the United States, and those laws and regulations are uncertain and subject change. For example, October , the European Court Justice invalidated the European Commission\' Safe Harbour Decision legitimate basis which Facebook could rely for the transfer data from the European Union the United States. addition, the other bases which Facebook relies are likely subject regulatory judicial scrutiny. Facebook unable transfer data between and among countries and regions which operates, could affect the manner which provide our services adversely affect our financial results. Proposed legislation and regulations could also significantly affect our business. There currently are number proposals pending before federal, state, and foreign legislative and regulatory bodies, including data protection regulation that pending final approval the European legislature that may include operational requirements for companies that receive process personal data that are different than those currently place the European Union, and that will include significant penalties for non-compliance.

These existing and proposed laws and regulations, well any associated inquiries, investigations, actions, can costly comply with and can delay impede the development new products, result negative publicity, increase our operating costs, require significant management time and attention, and subject remedies that may harm our business, including fines demands orders that modify cease existing business practices. have been subject regulatory investigations and settlements and expect continue subject such proceedings and other inquires the future, which could cause incur substantial costs require change our business practices manner materially adverse our business. From time time, receive formal and informal inquiries from government authorities and regulators regarding our compliance with laws and regulations, many which are evolving and subject interpretation. are and expect continue the subject investigations, inquiries, actions, and audits the United States, Europe, and around the world, particularly the areas consumer and data protection, continue grow and expand our operations. For example, several data protection authorities Europe have initiated actions seeking assert jurisdiction over Facebook Inc. and our subsidiaries and restrict the ways which collect and use information, and other data protection authorities may the same. Orders issued , inquiries enforcement actions initiated , government regulatory authorities could cause incur substantial costs, expose unanticipated civil and criminal liability penalties (including substantial monetary fines), require change our business practices manner materially adverse our business. are unable protect our intellectual property, the value our brands and other intangible assets may diminished, and our business may adversely affected. rely and expect continue rely combination confidentiality, assignment, and license agreements with our employees, consultants, and third parties with whom have relationships, well trademark, copyright, patent, trade secret, and domain name protection laws, protect our proprietary rights. the United States and internationally, have filed various applications for protection certain aspects our intellectual property, and currently hold number issued patents multiple jurisdictions and have acquired patents and patent applications from third parties. addition, the future may acquire additional patents patent portfolios, which could require significant cash expenditures. Third parties may knowingly unknowingly infringe our proprietary rights, third parties may challenge proprietary rights held , and pending and future trademark and patent applications may not approved. addition, effective intellectual property protection may not available every country which operate intend operate our business. any all these cases, may required expend significant time and expense order prevent infringement enforce our rights. Although have generally taken measures protect our proprietary rights, there can assurance that others will not offer products concepts that are substantially similar ours and compete with our business. addition, regularly contribute software source code under open source licenses and have made other technology developed available under other open licenses, and include open source software our products. For example, have contributed certain specifications and designs related our data center equipment the Open Compute Project Foundation, non-profit entity that shares and develops such information with the technology community, under the Open Web Foundation License. result our open source contributions and the use open source our products, may license required license disclose code and innovations that turn out material our business and may also exposed increased litigation risk. the protection our proprietary rights inadequate prevent unauthorized use appropriation third parties, the value our brands and other intangible assets may diminished and competitors may able more effectively mimic our products, services, and methods operations. Any these events could have adverse effect our business and financial results. are currently, and expect the future, party patent lawsuits and other intellectual property rights claims that are expensive and time consuming, and, resolved adversely, could have significant impact our business, financial condition, results operations. Companies the Internet, technology, and media industries own large numbers patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets, and frequently enter into litigation based allegations infringement, misappropriation, other violations intellectual property other rights. addition, various "non-practicing entities" that own patents and other intellectual property rights often attempt aggressively assert their rights order extract value from technology companies. Furthermore, from time time may introduce acquire new products, including areas where historically have not competed, which could increase our exposure patent and other intellectual property claims from competitors and non-practicing entities. From time time, receive notice letters from patent holders alleging that certain our products and services infringe their patent rights. presently are involved number intellectual property lawsuits, and face increasing competition and gain increasingly high profile, expect the number patent and other intellectual property claims against grow. Defending patent and other intellectual property litigation costly and can impose significant burden management and employees, and there can assurances that favorable final outcomes will obtained all cases. addition, plaintiffs may seek, and may become subject , preliminary provisional rulings the course any such litigation, including potential preliminary injunctions requiring cease some all our operations. may decide settle such lawsuits and disputes terms that are unfavorable . Similarly, any litigation which are party resolved adversely, may subject unfavorable judgment that may not reversed upon appeal. The terms such settlement judgment may require cease some all our operations pay substantial amounts the other party. addition, may have seek license continue practices found violation third party\' rights, which may not available reasonable terms, all, and may significantly increase our operating costs and expenses. result, may also required develop alternative non-infringing technology practices discontinue the practices. The development alternative non-infringing technology practices could require significant effort and expense may not feasible. Our business, financial condition, and results operations could adversely affected result unfavorable resolution the disputes and litigation referred above. are involved numerous class action lawsuits and other litigation matters that are expensive and time consuming, and, resolved adversely, could harm our business, financial condition, results operations. addition intellectual property claims, are also involved numerous other lawsuits, including putative class action lawsuits, many which claim statutory damages and seek significant changes our business operations, and anticipate that will continue target for numerous lawsuits the future. Because the scale our user base, the plaintiffs class action cases filed against typically claim enormous monetary damages even the alleged per-user harm small non-existent. addition, may subject additional class action lawsuits based product performance other claims related the use consumer hardware and software, well virtual reality technology and products, which are new and unproven. Any negative outcome from any such lawsuits could result payments substantial monetary damages fines, undesirable changes our products business practices, and accordingly our business, financial condition, results operations could materially and adversely affected. Although the results such lawsuits and claims cannot predicted with certainty, not believe that the final outcome those matters relating our products that currently face will have material adverse effect our business, financial condition, results operations. addition, are currently the subject stockholder class action suits connection with our IPO. believe these lawsuits are without merit and are vigorously defending these lawsuits. There can assurances that favorable final outcome will obtained all our cases, and defending any lawsuit costly and can impose significant burden management and employees. Any litigation which are party may result onerous unfavorable judgment that may not reversed upon appeal payments substantial monetary damages fines, may decide settle lawsuits similarly unfavorable terms, which could adversely affect our business, financial conditions, results operations. may incur liability result information retrieved from transmitted over the Internet published using our products result claims related our products. have faced, currently face, and will continue face claims relating information that published made available our products. particular, the nature our business exposes claims related defamation, intellectual property rights, rights publicity and privacy, and personal injury torts. This risk enhanced certain jurisdictions outside the United States where our protection from liability for third-party actions may unclear and where may less protected under local laws than are the United States. could incur significant costs investigating and defending such claims and, are found liable, significant damages. any these events occur, our business and financial results could adversely affected. Our CEO has control over key decision making result his control majority our voting stock. Mark Zuckerberg, our founder, Chairman, and CEO, able exercise voting rights with respect majority the voting power our outstanding capital stock and therefore has the ability control the outcome matters submitted our stockholders for approval, including the election directors and any merger, consolidation, sale all substantially all our assets. This concentrated control could delay, defer, prevent change control, merger, consolidation, sale all substantially all our assets that our other stockholders support, conversely this concentrated control could result the consummation such transaction that our other stockholders not support. This concentrated control could also discourage potential investor from acquiring our Class common stock due the limited voting power such stock relative the Class common stock and might harm the trading price our Class common stock. addition, . Zuckerberg has the ability control the management and major strategic investments our company result his position our CEO and his ability control the election replacement our directors. the event his death, the shares our capital stock that . Zuckerberg owns will transferred the persons entities that has designated. board member and officer, . Zuckerberg owes fiduciary duty our stockholders and must act good faith manner reasonably believes the best interests our stockholders. stockholder, even controlling stockholder, . Zuckerberg entitled vote his shares, and shares over which has voting control governed voting agreement, his own interests, which may not always the interests our stockholders generally. plan continue make acquisitions, which could harm our financial condition results operations and may adversely affect the price our common stock. part our business strategy, have made and intend continue make acquisitions add specialized employees and complementary companies, products, technologies. may not able find suitable acquisition candidates, and may not able complete acquisitions favorable terms, all. some cases, the costs such acquisitions may substantial. For example, paid approximately $ billion cash and issued million shares our Class common stock connection with our acquisition WhatsApp, and paid approximately $ million cash and issued million shares our Class common stock connection with our acquisition Oculus. also issued substantial number RSUs help retain the employees these companies. There assurance that will receive favorable return investment for these other acquisitions. the future, may pay substantial amounts cash incur debt pay for acquisitions, which could adversely affect our liquidity. The incurrence indebtedness would also result increased fixed obligations, increased interest expense, and could also include covenants other restrictions that would impede our ability manage our operations. may also issue equity securities pay for acquisitions and regularly grant RSUs retain the employees acquired companies, which could increase our expenses, adversely affect our financial results, and result dilution our stockholders. addition, any acquisitions announce could viewed negatively users, marketers, developers, investors, which may adversely affect our business the price our common stock. may also discover liabilities deficiencies associated with the companies assets acquire that were not identified advance, which may result significant unanticipated costs. The effectiveness our due diligence review and our ability evaluate the results such due diligence are dependent upon the accuracy and completeness statements and disclosures made actions taken the companies acquire their representatives, well the limited amount time which acquisitions are executed. addition, may fail accurately forecast the financial impact acquisition transaction, including tax and accounting charges. Acquisitions may also result our recording significant additional expenses our results operations and recording substantial finite-lived intangible assets our balance sheet upon closing. Any these factors may adversely affect our financial condition results operations. may not able successfully integrate our acquisitions, and may incur significant costs integrate and support the companies acquire. The integration acquisitions requires significant time and resources, and may not manage these processes successfully. Our ability successfully integrate complex acquisitions unproven, particularly with respect companies that have significant operations that develop products where not have prior experience. For example, Oculus and WhatsApp are larger and more complex than companies have historically acquired. particular, Oculus builds technology and products that are new Facebook and with which did not have significant experience structure place support prior the acquisition. are making substantial investments resources support these acquisitions, which will result significant ongoing operating expenses and may divert resources and management attention from other areas our business. cannot assure you that these investments will successful. fail successfully integrate the companies acquire, may not realize the benefits expected from the transaction and our business may harmed. our goodwill finite-lived intangible assets become impaired, may required record significant charge earnings. review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment when events changes circumstances indicate the carrying value may not recoverable, such decline stock price and market capitalization. test goodwill for impairment least annually. such goodwill finite-lived intangible assets are deemed impaired, impairment loss equal the amount which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value the assets would recognized. may required record significant charge our financial statements during the period which any impairment our goodwill finite-lived intangible assets determined, which would negatively affect our results operations. Our business dependent our ability maintain and scale our technical infrastructure, and any significant disruption our service could damage our reputation, result potential loss users and engagement, and adversely affect our financial results. Our reputation and ability attract, retain, and serve our users dependent upon the reliable performance our products and our underlying technical infrastructure. Our systems may not adequately designed with the necessary reliability and redundancy avoid performance delays outages that could harmful our business. our products are unavailable when users attempt access them, they not load quickly expected, users may not use our products often the future, all, and our ability serve ads may disrupted. our user base and engagement continue grow, and the amount and types information shared Facebook and our other products continue grow and evolve, such increased engagement with video, will need increasing amount technical infrastructure, including network capacity and computing power, continue satisfy the needs our users. possible that may fail effectively scale and grow our technical infrastructure accommodate these increased demands. addition, our business may subject interruptions, delays, failures resulting from earthquakes, adverse weather conditions, other natural disasters, power loss, terrorism, other catastrophic events. such event were occur, users may subject service disruptions outages and may not able recover our technical infrastructure and user data timely manner restart provide our services, which may adversely affect our financial results. substantial portion our network infrastructure provided third parties. Any disruption failure the services receive from these providers could harm our ability handle existing increased traffic and could significantly harm our business. Any financial other difficulties these providers face may adversely affect our business, and exercise little control over these providers, which increases our vulnerability problems with the services they provide. could experience unforeseen difficulties building and operating key portions our technical infrastructure. have designed and built our own data centers and key portions our technical infrastructure through which serve our products, and plan continue significantly expand the size our infrastructure primarily through data centers and other projects. The infrastructure expansion are undertaking complex, and unanticipated delays the completion these projects availability components may lead increased project costs, operational inefficiencies, interruptions the delivery degradation the quality our products. addition, there may issues related this infrastructure that are not identified during the testing phases design and implementation, which may only become evident after have started fully utilize the underlying equipment, that could further degrade the user experience increase our costs. Our products and internal systems rely software that highly technical, and contains undetected errors vulnerabilities, our business could adversely affected. Our products and internal systems rely software, including software developed maintained internally and third parties, that highly technical and complex. addition, our products and internal systems depend the ability such software store, retrieve, process, and manage immense amounts data. The software which rely has contained, and may now the future contain, undetected errors, bugs, vulnerabilities. Some errors may only discovered after the code has been released for external internal use. Errors, vulnerabilities, other design defects within the software which rely may result negative experience for users and marketers who use our products, delay product introductions enhancements, result measurement billing errors, compromise our ability protect the data our users and our intellectual property lead reductions our ability provide some all our services. For example, social games Facebook rely Adobe Flash, which games are currently responsible for substantially all our Payments revenue. July , certain vulnerabilities discovered Flash led temporary interruption support for Flash popular web browsers. similar interruptions occur the future and disrupt our ability provide social games some all our users, our ability generate Payments revenue would harmed. Any errors, bugs, vulnerabilities, defects discovered the software which rely, and any associated degradations interruptions service, could result damage our reputation, loss users, loss revenue, liability for damages, any which could adversely affect our business and financial results. Technologies have been developed that can block the display our ads, which could adversely affect our financial results. Technologies have been developed, and will likely continue developed, that can block the display our ads, particularly advertising displayed personal computers. generate substantially all our revenue from advertising, including revenue resulting from the display ads personal computers. Revenue generated from the display ads personal computers has been impacted these technologies from time time. result, these technologies have had adverse effect our financial results and, such technologies continue proliferate, particular with respect mobile platforms, our future financial results may harmed. Certain our user metrics are subject inherent challenges measurement, and real perceived inaccuracies such metrics may harm our reputation and negatively affect our business. The numbers for our key metrics, which include our DAUs, mobile DAUs, MAUs, mobile MAUs, and average revenue per user (ARPU), well certain other metrics such mobile-only DAUs and mobile-only MAUs, are calculated using internal company data based the activity user accounts. While these numbers are based what believe reasonable estimates our user base for the applicable period measurement, there are inherent challenges measuring usage our products across large online and mobile populations around the world. For example, there may individuals who maintain one more Facebook accounts violation our terms service. estimate, for example, that "duplicate" accounts ( account that user maintains addition his her principal account) may have represented less than % our worldwide MAUs . also seek identify "false" accounts, which divide into two categories: ( ) user-misclassified accounts, where users have created personal profiles for business, organization, non-human entity such pet (such entities are permitted Facebook using Page rather than personal profile under our terms service); and ( ) undesirable accounts, which represent user profiles that determine are intended used for purposes that violate our terms service, such spamming. , for example, estimate that such user-misclassified and undesirable accounts may have represented less than % our worldwide MAUs. believe the percentage accounts that are duplicate false meaningfully lower developed markets such the United States United Kingdom and higher developing markets such India and Turkey. However, these estimates are based internal review limited sample accounts and apply significant judgment making this determination, such identifying names that appear fake other behavior that appears inauthentic the reviewers. such, our estimation duplicate false accounts may not accurately represent the actual number such accounts. are continually seeking improve our ability identify duplicate false accounts and estimate the total number such accounts, and such estimates may change due improvements changes our methodology. Our data limitations may affect our understanding certain details our business. For example, while user-provided data indicates decline usage among younger users, this age data unreliable because disproportionate number our younger users register with inaccurate age. Accordingly, our understanding usage age group may not complete. Some our metrics have also been affected applications certain mobile devices that automatically contact our servers for regular updates with user action involved, and this activity can cause our system count the user associated with such device active user the day such contact occurs. The impact this automatic activity our metrics varied geography because mobile usage varies different regions the world. addition, our data regarding the geographic location our users estimated based number factors, such the user\' address and self-disclosed location. These factors may not always accurately reflect the user\' actual location. For example, mobile-only user may appear accessing Facebook from the location the proxy server that the user connects rather than from the user\' actual location. The methodologies used measure user metrics may also susceptible algorithm other technical errors. Our estimates for revenue user location and revenue user device are also affected these factors. regularly review our processes for calculating these metrics, and from time time may discover inaccuracies our metrics make adjustments improve their accuracy, including adjustments that may result the recalculation our historical metrics. believe that any such inaccuracies adjustments are immaterial unless otherwise stated. addition, our DAU and MAU estimates will differ from estimates published third parties due differences methodology. For example, some third parties are not able accurately measure mobile users not count mobile users for certain user groups all their analyses. marketers, developers, investors not perceive our user metrics accurate representations our user base, discover material inaccuracies our user metrics, our reputation may harmed and marketers and developers may less willing allocate their budgets resources Facebook, which could negatively affect our business and financial results. cannot assure you that will effectively manage our growth. Our employee headcount and the scope and complexity our business have increased significantly, with the number employees increasing , December , from , December , , and expect headcount growth continue for the foreseeable future. The growth and expansion our business and products create significant challenges for our management, operational, and financial resources, including managing multiple relations with users, marketers, developers, and other third parties. the event continued growth our operations the number our third-party relationships, our information technology systems our internal controls and procedures may not adequate support our operations. addition, some members our management not have significant experience managing large global business operation, our management may not able manage such growth effectively. effectively manage our growth, must continue improve our operational, financial, and management processes and systems and effectively expand, train, and manage our employee base. our organization continues grow, and are required implement more complex organizational management structures, may find increasingly difficult maintain the benefits our corporate culture, including our ability quickly develop and launch new and innovative products. This could negatively affect our business performance. The loss one more our key personnel, our failure attract and retain other highly qualified personnel the future, could harm our business. currently depend the continued services and performance our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg and Sheryl . Sandberg. Although have entered into employment agreements with . Zuckerberg and . Sandberg, the agreements have specific duration and constitute -will employment. addition, many our key technologies and systems are custom-made for our business our personnel. The loss key personnel, including members management well key engineering, product development, marketing, and sales personnel, could disrupt our operations and have adverse effect our business. continue grow, cannot guarantee will continue attract the personnel need maintain our competitive position. particular, intend continue hire significant number technical personnel the foreseeable future, and expect face significant competition from other companies hiring such personnel, particularly the San Francisco Bay Area, where our headquarters are located and where the cost living high. mature, the incentives attract, retain, and motivate employees provided our equity awards future arrangements may not effective the past, and issue significant equity attract additional employees, the ownership our existing stockholders may further diluted. Our ability attract, retain, and motivate employees may also adversely affected stock price volatility. Additionally, have number current employees whose equity ownership our company has provided them substantial amount personal wealth, which could affect their decisions about whether not continue work for . result these factors, may difficult for continue retain and motivate our employees. not succeed attracting, hiring, and integrating excellent personnel, retaining and motivating existing personnel, may unable grow effectively. may not able continue successfully grow usage and engagement with mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products. have made and are continuing make investments enable developers build, grow, and monetize mobile and web applications that integrate with Facebook and our other products. Such existing and prospective developers may not successful building, growing, monetizing mobile and web applications that create and maintain user engagement. Additionally, developers may choose build other platforms, including mobile platforms controlled third parties, rather than building products that integrate with Facebook and our other products. are continuously seeking balance the distribution objectives our developers with our desire provide optimal user experience, and may not successful achieving balance that continues attract and retain such developers. For example, from time time, have taken actions reduce the volume communications from these developers users Facebook and our other products with the objective enhancing the user experience, and such actions have reduced distribution from, user engagement with, and our monetization opportunities from, mobile and web applications integrated with our products. some instances, these actions, well other actions enforce our policies applicable developers, have adversely affected our relationships with such developers. are not successful our efforts continue grow the number developers that choose build products that integrate with Facebook and our other products are unable continue build and maintain good relations with such developers, our user growth and user engagement and our financial results may adversely affected. currently generate all our Payments revenue from developers that use Facebook personal computers, and expect that our Payments revenue will continue decline the future usage Facebook personal computers continues decline. currently generate all our Payments revenue from developers that use Facebook personal computers. Specifically, applications built developers social games are currently responsible for substantially all our revenue derived from Payments, and the majority the revenue from these applications has historically been generated limited number the most popular games. have experienced and expect see the continued decline usage Facebook personal computers for the foreseeable future, which expect will result continuing decline Payments revenue. addition, relatively small percentage our users have transacted with Facebook Payments. the Facebook-integrated applications fail grow maintain their users and engagement, whether result the continued decline the usage Facebook personal computers otherwise, developers not continue introduce new applications that attract users and create engagement Facebook, Facebook-integrated applications outside social games not gain popularity and generate significant revenue for , our financial performance could adversely affected. Payment transactions may subject additional regulatory requirements and other risks that could costly and difficult comply with that could harm our business. Our users can purchase virtual and digital goods from developers that offer applications using our Payments infrastructure the Facebook website. addition, certain our users can use our Payments infrastructure for other activities, such sending money other users and making donations certain charitable organizations. are subject variety laws and regulations the United States, Europe, and elsewhere, including those governing anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing, money transmission, gift cards and other prepaid access instruments, electronic funds transfer, charitable fundraising, and import and export restrictions. Depending how our Payments product evolves, may also subject other laws and regulations including those governing gambling, banking, and lending. some jurisdictions, the application interpretation these laws and regulations not clear. increase flexibility how our use Payments may evolve and mitigate regulatory uncertainty, have received certain money transmitter licenses the United States and are applying for certain regulatory licenses Europe, which will generally require demonstrate compliance with many domestic and foreign laws these areas. Our efforts comply with these laws and regulations could costly and result diversion management time and effort and may still not guarantee compliance. the event that are found violation any such legal regulatory requirements, may subject monetary fines other penalties such cease and desist order, may required make product changes, any which could have adverse effect our business and financial results. addition, may subject variety additional risks result Payments transactions, including: • increased costs and diversion management time and effort and other resources deal with bad transactions customer disputes; • potential fraudulent otherwise illegal activity users, developers, employees, third parties; • restrictions the investment consumer funds used transact Payments; and • additional disclosure and reporting requirements. have significant international operations and plan continue expanding our operations abroad where have limited operating experience, and this may subject increased business and economic risks that could affect our financial results. have significant international operations and plan continue the international expansion our business operations and the translation our products. currently make Facebook available more than different languages, and have offices data centers more than different countries. may enter new international markets where have limited experience marketing, selling, and deploying our products. Our products are generally available globally through the web and mobile, but some all our products functionality may not available certain markets due legal and regulatory complexities. For example, Facebook not generally available China. also outsource certain operational functions third-party vendors globally. fail deploy, manage, oversee our international operations successfully, our business may suffer. addition, are subject variety risks inherent doing business internationally, including: • political, social, economic instability; • risks related the legal and regulatory environment foreign jurisdictions, including with respect privacy, tax, law enforcement, content, trade compliance, intellectual property, and terrestrial infrastructure matters; • potential damage our brand and reputation due compliance with local laws, including potential censorship requirements provide user information local authorities; • fluctuations currency exchange rates and compliance with currency controls; • foreign exchange controls and tax regulations that might prevent from repatriating cash earned countries outside the United States otherwise limit our ability move cash freely, and impede our ability invest such cash efficiently; • higher levels credit risk and payment fraud; • enhanced difficulties integrating any foreign acquisitions; • burdens complying with variety foreign laws; • reduced protection for intellectual property rights some countries; • difficulties staffing, managing, and overseeing global operations and the increased travel, infrastructure, and legal compliance costs associated with multiple international locations; • compliance with the . Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, the . Bribery Act, and similar laws other jurisdictions; and • compliance with statutory equity requirements and management tax consequences. are unable expand internationally and manage the complexity our global operations successfully, our financial results could adversely affected. face design, manufacturing, and supply chain risks that, not properly managed, could adversely impact our financial results. face number risks related design, manufacturing, and supply chain management with respect our Oculus products. For example, the Oculus products sell may have quality issues resulting from the design manufacture the products, from the software used the products. Sometimes, these issues may caused components purchase from other manufacturers suppliers. the quality our Oculus products does not meet our customers\' expectations such products are found defective, then our financial results could adversely affected. rely third parties manufacture our Oculus products. may experience supply shortages other supply chain disruptions the future that could negatively impact our operations. could negatively affected are not able engage third parties with the necessary capabilities capacity reasonable terms, those engage with fail meet their obligations (whether due financial difficulties other reasons), make adverse changes the pricing other material terms such arrangements with them. also require the suppliers and business partners our Oculus products comply with law and certain company policies regarding sourcing practices, but not control them their practices. any them violates laws implements practices regarded unethical, could experience supply chain disruptions, canceled orders, terminations damage our reputation. addition, the Securities and Exchange Commission’ conflict minerals rule requires disclosure public companies the origin, source and chain custody specified minerals, known conflict minerals, that are necessary the functionality production products manufactured contracted manufactured. may incur significant costs associated with complying with the rule, such costs related the determination the origin, source and chain custody the minerals used Oculus products, the adoption conflict minerals-related governance policies, processes and controls, and possible changes products sources supply result such activities. may face inventory risk with respect our Oculus products. may exposed inventory risks with respect our Oculus products result rapid changes product cycles and pricing, defective merchandise, changes consumer demand and consumer spending patterns, changes consumer tastes with respect Oculus products, and other factors. endeavor accurately predict these trends and avoid overstocking understocking products Oculus may sell. Demand for products, however, can change significantly between the time inventory components are ordered and the date sale. addition, when begin selling manufacturing new Oculus product, may difficult establish vendor relationships, determine appropriate product component selection, and accurately forecast demand. The acquisition certain types inventory components may require significant lead-time and prepayment and they may not returnable. Any one these factors may adversely affect our operating results. may incur substantial amount indebtedness, which could adversely affect our financial condition. August , entered into five-year senior unsecured revolving credit facility under which may borrow $ billion fund working capital and general corporate purposes. December , , amounts were outstanding under this facility. draw down this facility the future, our interest expense and principal repayment requirements will increase significantly, which could have adverse effect our financial results. may require additional capital support our business growth, and this capital may not available acceptable terms, all. may require additional capital support our business growth respond business opportunities, challenges unforeseen circumstances. Our ability obtain additional capital, and when required, will depend our business plans, investor demand, our operating performance, the condition the capital markets, and other factors. raise additional funds through the issuance equity, equity-linked debt securities, those securities may have rights, preferences, privileges senior the rights our Class common stock, and our existing stockholders may experience dilution. are unable obtain additional capital when required, are unable obtain additional capital satisfactory terms, our ability continue support our business growth respond business opportunities, challenges, unforeseen circumstances could adversely affected, and our business may harmed. may have exposure greater than anticipated tax liabilities. Our income tax obligations are based part our corporate operating structure and intercompany arrangements, including the manner which operate our business, develop, value, manage, protect, and use our intellectual property and the valuations our intercompany transactions. The tax laws applicable our business, including the laws the United States and other jurisdictions, are subject interpretation and certain jurisdictions are aggressively interpreting their laws new ways effort raise additional tax revenue from companies such Facebook. The taxing authorities the jurisdictions which operate may challenge our methodologies for valuing developed technology intercompany arrangements, which could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results operations. are subject regular review and audit . federal and state and foreign tax authorities. Tax authorities may disagree with certain positions have taken and any adverse outcome such review audit could have negative effect our financial position and results operations. addition, the determination our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment management, and there are many transactions where the ultimate tax determination uncertain. Our provision for income taxes also determined the manner which operate our business, and any changes such operations laws applicable such operations may affect our effective tax rate. Although believe that our estimates are reasonable, the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results the period periods for which such determination made. addition, our future income taxes could adversely affected earnings being lower than anticipated jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates, changes the valuation our deferred tax assets and liabilities, changes tax laws, regulations, accounting principles. For example, have previously incurred losses certain international subsidiaries that resulted effective tax rate that significantly higher than the statutory tax rate the United States and this could continue happen the future. Changes tax laws tax rulings could materially affect our financial position and results operations. The tax regimes are subject operate under are unsettled and may subject significant change. Changes tax laws tax rulings, changes interpretations existing laws, could materially affect our financial position and results operations. Many countries Europe, well number other countries and organizations, have recently proposed recommended changes existing tax laws have enacted new laws that could significantly increase our tax obligations many countries where business require change the manner which operate our business. For example, the United Kingdom enacted the Diverted Profits Tax and Australia passed The Tax Integrity Multinational Anti-avoidance Law, both which could increase our tax obligations. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development has been working Base Erosion and Profit Sharing Project, and has issued , and expected continue issue, guidelines and proposals that may change various aspects the existing framework under which our tax obligations are determined many the countries which business. The European Commission has conducted investigations multiple countries focusing whether local country tax rulings tax legislation provides preferential tax treatment that violates European Union state aid rules. These investigations may result changes the tax treatment our foreign operations. addition, the current . administration and key members Congress have made public statements indicating that tax reform priority. Certain changes . tax laws, including limitations the ability defer . taxation earnings outside the United States until those earnings are repatriated the United States, could affect the tax treatment our foreign earnings. Due the large and expanding scale our international business activities, many these types changes the taxation our activities could increase our worldwide effective tax rate and harm our financial position and results operations. Risks Related Ownership Our Class Common Stock The trading price our Class common stock has been and will likely continue volatile. The trading price our Class common stock has been, and likely continue , volatile. Since shares our Class common stock were sold our IPO May price $ per share, our stock price has ranged from $ $ through December , . addition the factors discussed this Annual Report Form - , the trading price our Class common stock may fluctuate significantly response numerous factors, many which are beyond our control, including: • actual anticipated fluctuations our revenue and other operating results; • the financial projections may provide the public, any changes these projections our failure meet these projections; • actions securities analysts who initiate maintain coverage , changes financial estimates any securities analysts who follow our company, our failure meet these estimates the expectations investors; • additional shares our Class common stock being sold into the market , our existing stockholders, connection with acquisitions, including shares sold our employees cover tax liabilities connection with RSU vesting events, the anticipation such sales; • investor sentiment with respect our competitors, our business partners, and our industry general; • announcements our competitors significant products features, technical innovations, acquisitions, strategic partnerships, joint ventures, capital commitments; • announcements estimates third parties actual anticipated changes the size our user base, the level user engagement, the effectiveness our products; • changes operating performance and stock market valuations technology companies our industry, including our developers and competitors; • price and volume fluctuations the overall stock market, including result trends the economy whole; • the inclusion deletion our Class common stock from any trading indices, such the & Index; • media coverage our business and financial performance; • lawsuits threatened filed against ; • developments anticipated new legislation and pending lawsuits regulatory actions, including interim final rulings tax, judicial, regulatory bodies; and • other events factors, including those resulting from war incidents terrorism, responses these events. addition, the stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected and continue affect the market prices equity securities many technology companies. Stock prices many technology companies have fluctuated manner unrelated disproportionate the operating performance those companies. are currently subject securities litigation connection with our IPO. may experience more such litigation following future periods volatility. Any securities litigation could subject substantial costs, divert resources and the attention management from our business, and adversely affect our business. not intend pay dividends for the foreseeable future. have never declared paid cash dividends our capital stock. currently intend retain any future earnings finance the operation and expansion our business, and not expect declare pay any dividends the foreseeable future. result, you may only receive return your investment our Class common stock the trading price our Class common stock increases. addition, our credit facility contains restrictions our ability pay dividends. The dual class structure our common stock and voting agreement between certain stockholders have the effect concentrating voting control with our CEO and certain other holders our Class common stock; this will limit preclude your ability influence corporate matters. Our Class common stock has ten votes per share, and our Class common stock has one vote per share. Stockholders who hold shares Class common stock, including certain our executive officers, employees, and directors and their affiliates, together hold substantial majority the voting power our outstanding capital stock. Because the ten- -one voting ratio between our Class and Class common stock, the holders our Class common stock collectively control majority the combined voting power our common stock and therefore are able control all matters submitted our stockholders for approval long the shares Class common stock represent least % all outstanding shares our Class and Class common stock. This concentrated control will limit preclude your ability influence corporate matters for the foreseeable future. Transfers holders Class common stock will generally result those shares converting Class common stock, subject limited exceptions, such certain transfers effected for estate planning charitable purposes. The conversion Class common stock Class common stock will have the effect, over time, increasing the relative voting power those holders Class common stock who retain their shares the long term. , for example, . Zuckerberg retains significant portion his holdings Class common stock for extended period time, could, the future, continue control majority the combined voting power our Class common stock and Class common stock. have elected take advantage the "controlled company" exemption the corporate governance rules for NASDAQ-listed companies, which could make our Class common stock less attractive some investors otherwise harm our stock price. Because qualify "controlled company" under the corporate governance rules for NASDAQ-listed companies, are not required have majority our board directors independent, nor are required have compensation committee independent nominating function. light our status controlled company, our board directors determined not have independent nominating function and chose have the full board directors directly responsible for nominating members our board, and the future could elect not have majority our board directors independent not have compensation committee.

Trends Our Monetization User Geography calculate our revenue user geography based our estimate the geography which impressions are delivered virtual and digital goods are purchased. define ARPU our total revenue given geography during given quarter, divided the average the number MAUs the geography the beginning and end the quarter. While ARPU includes all sources revenue, the number MAUs used this calculation only includes users Facebook and Messenger described the definition MAU above. The geography our users affects our revenue and financial results because currently monetize users different geographies different average rates. Our revenue and ARPU regions such United States & Canada and Europe are relatively higher primarily due the size and maturity those online and mobile advertising markets. For example, ARPU the United States & Canada region was more than seven times higher than the Asia-Pacific region. Note: Our revenue user geography the charts above geographically apportioned based our estimation the geographic location our users when they perform revenue-generating activity. This allocation differs from our revenue geography disclosure our consolidated financial statements where revenue geographically apportioned based the location the marketer developer. For , worldwide ARPU was $ , increase % from . Over this period, ARPU increased % United States & Canada, % Europe, % Asia-Pacific, and % Rest World. The general strengthening the . dollar relative certain foreign currencies from had unfavorable impact the growth rate our ARPU outside the United States and Canada region. addition, user growth was more rapid geographies with relatively lower ARPU, such Asia-Pacific and Rest World. expect that user growth the future will primarily concentrated those regions where ARPU relatively lower, such Asia-Pacific and Rest World, such that worldwide ARPU may continue increase slower rate relative ARPU any geographic region, potentially decrease even ARPU increases each geographic region. Critical Accounting Policies and Estimates Our consolidated financial statements are prepared accordance with . generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). The preparation these consolidated financial statements requires make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts assets, liabilities, revenue, costs and expenses, and related disclosures. evaluate our estimates and assumptions ongoing basis. Our estimates are based historical experience and various other assumptions that believe reasonable under the circumstances. Our actual results could differ from these estimates. accounting policy deemed critical requires accounting estimate made based assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain the time the estimate made, different estimates reasonably could have been used, changes the estimate that are reasonably possible could materially impact the financial statements. believe that the assumptions and estimates associated with revenue recognition for payments and other fees, income taxes, share-based compensation, loss contingencies, and business combinations and valuation goodwill and other acquired intangible assets have the greatest potential impact our consolidated financial statements. Therefore, consider these our critical accounting policies and estimates. For further information all our significant accounting policies, see Note our accompanying Notes Consolidated Financial Statements included Part , Item , "Financial Statements and Supplementary Data" this Annual Report Form - . Revenue Recognition for Payments and Other Fees enable Payments from people purchase virtual and digital goods from developers. People can make payments Facebook using debit and credit cards, PayPal, mobile phone payments, gift cards, other methods. receive fee from developers when person engages payment transaction for the purchase virtual digital good the Facebook website. The price the virtual digital good price that solely determined the developer. remit the developer amount that based the total amount transaction less the processing fee that charge the developer for the service performed. Our revenue the net amount the transaction representing our processing fee for the transaction. record revenue net basis not consider ourselves the principal the sale the virtual digital good the person. Under GAAP guidance related reporting revenue gross principal versus net agent, the indicators used determine whether entity principal agent transaction are subject judgment. consider ourselves the agent these transactions when apply the indicators our facts. Should material subsequent changes the substance nature the transactions with developers result being considered the principal such sales, would reflect the virtual and digital goods sale revenue and the amounts paid the developers associated cost. Income Taxes are subject income taxes the United States and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment required determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties the application accounting principles and complex tax laws. record provision for income taxes for the anticipated tax consequences the reported results operations using the asset and liability method. Under this method, recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases assets and liabilities, well for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the tax rates that are expected apply taxable income for the years which those tax assets and liabilities are expected realized settled. record valuation allowance reduce our deferred tax assets the net amount that believe more likely than not realized. recognize tax benefits from uncertain tax positions only believe that more likely than not that the tax position will sustained examination the taxing authorities based the technical merits the position. Although believe that have adequately reserved for our uncertain tax positions, can provide assurance that the final tax outcome these matters will not materially different. make adjustments these reserves when facts and circumstances change, such the closing tax audit the refinement estimate. the extent that the final tax outcome these matters different than the amounts recorded, such differences will affect the provision for income taxes the period which such determination made and could have material impact our financial condition and operating results. The provision for income taxes includes the effects any reserves that believe are appropriate, well the related net interest and penalties. Share-based Compensation account for share-based employee compensation plans under the fair value recognition and measurement provisions accordance with applicable accounting standards, which require all share-based payments employees, including grants stock options and restricted stock units (RSUs), measured based the grant date fair value the awards, with the resulting expense generally recognized straight-line basis over the period during which the employee required perform service exchange for the award. Share-based compensation expense recorded net estimated forfeitures our consolidated statements income and such recorded for only those share-based awards that expect vest. estimate the forfeiture rate based historical forfeitures equity awards and adjust the rate reflect changes facts and circumstances, any. will revise our estimated forfeiture rate actual forfeitures differ from our initial estimates. have historically issued unvested restricted shares employee stockholders certain acquired companies. these awards are generally subject continued post-acquisition employment, have accounted for them post-acquisition share-based compensation expense. recognize compensation expense equal the grant date fair value the common stock straight-line basis over the period during which the employee required perform service exchange for the award. Loss Contingencies are involved various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise the ordinary course business. Certain these matters include speculative claims for substantial indeterminate amounts damages. record liability when believe that both probable that loss has been incurred and the amount can reasonably estimated. Significant judgment required determine both probability and the estimated amount. review these provisions least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly reflect the impact negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice legal counsel, and updated information. believe that the amount estimable range reasonably possible loss, will not, either individually the aggregate, have material adverse effect our business, consolidated financial position, results operations, cash flows with respect loss contingencies for legal and other contingencies December , . However, the outcome litigation inherently uncertain. Therefore, one more these legal matters were resolved against for amounts excess management\' expectations, our results operations and financial condition, including particular reporting period, could materially adversely affected. Business Combinations and Valuation Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets allocate the fair value purchase consideration the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed, and intangible assets acquired based their estimated fair values. The excess the fair value purchase consideration over the fair values these identifiable assets and liabilities recorded goodwill. Such valuations require management make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect intangible assets. Significant estimates valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited , future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from market participant perspective, useful lives, and discount rates. Management’ estimates fair value are based upon assumptions believed reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which one year from the acquisition date, may record adjustments the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset goodwill. Upon the conclusion the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded earnings. review goodwill for impairment least annually more frequently events changes circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value our single reporting unit below its carrying value. evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually more frequently events changes circumstances indicate that more likely than not that the asset impaired. December , , impairment goodwill indefinite-lived intangible assets has been identified. Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives. evaluate the recoverability our intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events circumstances indicate that the carrying amount such assets may not recoverable. The evaluation performed the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent the cash flows other assets and liabilities. Recoverability these assets measured comparison the carrying amounts the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected generate. such review indicates that the carrying amount property and equipment and intangible assets not recoverable, the carrying amount such assets reduced fair value. have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented. addition the recoverability assessment, routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives our finite-lived intangible assets. reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would amortized over the revised estimated useful life.

Advertising Expense Advertising costs are expensed when incurred and are included marketing and sales expenses the accompanying consolidated statements income. incurred advertising expenses $ million , $ million , and $ million for the years ended December , , , and , respectively. Cash and Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities Cash and cash equivalents primarily consist cash deposit with banks and investments money market funds with maturities days less from the date purchase. hold investments marketable securities, consisting . government securities, . government agency securities, and corporate debt securities . classify our marketable securities available-for-sale investments our current assets because they represent investments cash available for current operations. Our available-for-sale investments are carried estimated fair value with any unrealized gains and losses, net taxes, included accumulated other comprehensive (loss) income stockholders\' equity. Unrealized losses are charged against interest and other income/(expense), net when decline fair value determined other-than-temporary. have not recorded any such impairment charge the periods presented. determine realized gains losses sale marketable securities specific identification method, and record such gains losses interest and other income/(expense), net. classify certain restricted cash balances within prepaid expenses and other current assets and other assets the accompanying consolidated balance sheets based upon the term the remaining restrictions. Fair Value Financial Instruments apply fair value accounting for all financial assets and liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized disclosed fair value the financial statements recurring basis. define fair value the price that would received from selling asset paid transfer liability orderly transaction between market participants the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required recorded fair value, consider the principal most advantageous market which would transact and the market-based risk measurements assumptions that market participants would use pricing the asset liability, such risks inherent valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit risk. Fair value estimated applying the following hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used measure fair value into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level input that available and significant the fair value measurement: Level -Quoted prices active markets for identical assets liabilities. Level -Observable inputs other than quoted prices active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical similar assets liabilities inactive markets, other inputs that are observable can corroborated observable market data for substantially the full term the assets liabilities. Level -Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect management\' estimate assumptions that market participants would use pricing the asset liability. Our valuation techniques used measure the fair value money market funds and marketable debt securities were derived from quoted market prices alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs. Our valuation technique used measure the fair value our contingent consideration liability was based the present value probability-weighted future cash flows related the contingent earn-out criteria and the fair value our common stock each reporting date. Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts Accounts receivable are recorded and carried the original invoiced amount less allowance for any potential uncollectible amounts. make estimates for the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our assessment various factors, including historical experience, the age the accounts receivable balances, credit quality our customers, current economic conditions, and other factors that may affect customers\' ability pay. Property and Equipment Property and equipment, which includes amounts recorded under capital leases, are stated cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives the assets the remaining lease term, the case capital lease, whichever shorter. The estimated useful lives property and equipment are described below: Property and Equipment Useful Life Network equipment Three five years Buildings Three years Computer software, office equipment and other Three five years Leased equipment and leasehold improvements Lesser estimated useful life remaining lease term Land and assets held within construction progress are not depreciated. Construction progress related the construction development property and equipment that have not yet been placed service for their intended use. The cost maintenance and repairs expensed incurred. When assets are retired otherwise disposed , the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed from their respective accounts, and any gain loss such sale disposal reflected income from operations. Lease Obligations lease office space, data centers, and equipment under non-cancelable capital and operating leases with various expiration dates through . Certain the operating lease agreements contain rent holidays, rent escalation provisions, and purchase options. Rent holidays and rent escalation provisions are considered determining the straight-line rent expense recorded over the lease term. The lease term begins the date initial possession the leased property for purposes recognizing lease expense straight-line basis over the term the lease. not assume renewals our determination the lease term unless the renewals are deemed reasonably assured lease inception. record assets and liabilities for the estimated construction costs incurred third parties under build- -suit lease arrangements the extent that are involved the construction structural improvements bear construction risk prior commencement lease. Loss Contingencies are involved various lawsuits, claims, investigations, and proceedings that arise the ordinary course business. record liability when believe that both probable that loss has been incurred and the amount can reasonably estimated. Significant judgment required determine both probability and the estimated amount. review these provisions least quarterly and adjust these provisions accordingly reflect the impact negotiations, settlements, rulings, advice legal counsel, and updated information. Business Combinations allocate the fair value purchase consideration the tangible assets acquired, liabilities assumed and intangible assets acquired based their estimated fair values. The excess the fair value purchase consideration over the fair values these identifiable assets and liabilities recorded goodwill. Such valuations require management make significant estimates and assumptions, especially with respect intangible assets. Significant estimates valuing certain intangible assets include, but are not limited , future expected cash flows from acquired users, acquired technology, and trade names from market participant perspective, useful lives and discount rates. Management’ estimates fair value are based upon assumptions believed reasonable, but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable and, result, actual results may differ from estimates. During the measurement period, which one year from the acquisition date, may record adjustments the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, with the corresponding offset goodwill. Upon the conclusion the measurement period, any subsequent adjustments are recorded earnings. Long-Lived Assets, Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets evaluate the recoverability property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets for possible impairment whenever events circumstances indicate that the carrying amount such assets may not recoverable. The evaluation performed the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent the cash flows other assets and liabilities. Recoverability these assets measured comparison the carrying amounts the future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected generate. such review indicates that the carrying amount property and equipment and intangible assets not recoverable, the carrying amount such assets reduced fair value. have not recorded any significant impairment charges during the years presented. review goodwill for impairment least annually more frequently events changes circumstances would more likely than not reduce the fair value our single reporting unit below its carrying value. evaluate indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment annually more frequently events changes circumstances indicate that more likely than not that the asset impaired. December , , impairment goodwill indefinite-lived intangible assets has been identified. Acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets related our -process research and development (IPR& ) are capitalized and subject impairment testing until completion abandonment the projects. Upon successful completion each project, will make separate determination useful life the acquired indefinite-lived intangible assets and the related amortization will recorded expense over the estimated useful life the specific projects. Acquired finite-lived intangible assets are amortized straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives the assets. routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives property and equipment and finite-lived intangible assets. reduce the estimated useful life assumption for any asset, the remaining unamortized balance would amortized depreciated over the revised estimated useful life.
